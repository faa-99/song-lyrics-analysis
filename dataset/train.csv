Dean Lewis,sad,"Early mornin' there's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying ""Darlin', please come home""
I fear the worst, but how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say, but there's so little time


So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes


And I promise, if you go
I will make sure she's alright


So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?


And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light


So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?2",0

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tori Kelly]
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

Passenger,sad,"I was born a baby boy a long time ago
Back when the hillsides were green
And the water would flow
But nights they fall and settle like snow
I watched as the hillsides turned white
With nowhere to go

Oh, think I'm gonna start a fire
Oh, think I'm gonna start a fire, oh

Now my heart's a frozen lake where streams used to flow
Down to the forest of my mind where memory would grow
Now I walk amongst the trees where the last sun glows
The leaves are all golden and brown with nowhere to go
Oh, think I'm gonna start a fire
And oh, think I'm gonna start a fire now

My skin like these boulders
Is cracking and older
With each passing year that goes
My cliff face is crumbling
Silently tumbling
Down to the water below
And if I light a match I'll be able to catch
The last sun before it goes

I got over you

You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist

Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane

I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain

Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy

Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Have been laid upon your table

Your pain and your hunger, drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night-time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?

Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts

Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two Rotts

And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?

And now you're killing me softly
You're saying things with your body
So I take your hand and then we go
All eyes on you
And I pull you in closer
You got me hooked and you know it
You're like a gamble
But I love playing it loose

You— You are my high, feel me love

[Verse]
Some of these guys just bad on a desktop tryna bring on a 'net war
Me and Elizabeth stood in a wedlock, I don't know why them guys upset for
How can I not shit on my doorstep? Somebody smokin' next door
Zs were white like parmesan and the box is green like pesto pasta
Family first then money comes second, the rest don't matter
They think that I came up quick, they don't know 'bout the rest of the chapters
I'm from where the Jackboys active
Don't sleep with your window open
Don't ever leave your door on the latches
Bro got two, next time that he scores, it's a hattrick
I had a big dream from young, some shit that I done, I couldn't imagine
Why would I dwell on the past? Without that, maybe this wouldn't have happened
Me and the bros in a new environment, I feel like the only one adaptin'
Bro's still ready to wrap man, shank man, some of the guys still trappin'
Uh, in the Shard with the dargs, the starter's prawns, the main is seabass
My darg won't ask for help, that hurts me hard, I don't like when I see that
If YJ run off with your pack, I swear, you won't get that weed back
I don't even care 'bout the rap, I don't even need no feedback
Remember the rap game didn't accept me, now you see the reception
Remember them girls, they try reject me, now they're so quick to come to the bedroom
Remember when my girl left me and now she gotta cope with depression
I can get over my exes same way I can get over recession
Inflation, I'm ready for that when the prices raisin'
Only thing on my mind was paper, now only thing on my mind is payback
The show that I done today is more than my parents' life savings
Survivors guilt, I'm dealin' with that, so tell me the price, I'll pay that
I feel like buyin' the shop at the job I applied for way back
Remember washin' my body with Fairy Liquid, he ran out of Radox
I'm only human, I still feel sad when I'm sat in the back of a Maybach
I thought that my life was hard 'til I went to the orphanage in Lagos

Taylor Swift,sad,"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you


Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go

If you cut the cord, I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute

""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again

Part II: ***Flawless
[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie & Beyoncé]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

Nefret ettiklerim, sevdiklerim için dua et
Kulüpte takılırken karaciğerim için dua et
Şeytanların uzaklaşması için dua ediyorum, bizlere musallat oluyorlar
Adamım, yaşadığımız bu yaşam tarzını artık kaldıramıyorum
Adamım, tepedeki bu beyaz güçleri artık kaldıramıyorum
Kapmalıyım J-Will'i, toplamalıyım J-Rich'i

Fenalaştım, tedirginleştim, kabul ediyorum
Kendimden geçtim, hayatla doldum, bomba gibi hissettirdi
İyice düşündüm zina yapmayı, ortalığı sikip atabilirim
Bana çılgınmışım gibi bakmaları komünistmişim gibi hissettirdi
Ama ben sadece tahtı kurtarmaya çalışıyorum, Bones için dua ediyorum, Stix için dua ediyorum

Sikimin Pringles kutusundan uzun olup olmadığını bilmek istiyor
Siyahi çocukları FOX'ta görmekten bıktım
Ve sikeyim CNN'i, bizlerin kazandığını görmek istemiyorlar

Ve eğer bilmiyorsan, senin kıza sor, o muhtemelen yolu biliyordur
Gösterilerdeki ışıkları seviyor, karım olmak istiyor
Bana sahip olursa hayatı boyunca iyi olacağını biliyor
Bu yüzden hi-hat'ten hızlı çıkarıyorum zevkin doruğundayken
Üzgünüm, bebeğim, ben oyun oynamam

And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it

For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face

Last time I was at his place, I was way too weird, I couldn't stay
I told Holly I was good 'til you're around

Did you mean to keep me out 'til 4 AM just to
Leave me on the street with a drink in my hand?

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (You ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered

And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin

Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another ""like you""
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (Wo-oahh)
And I'm thinking I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?


I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now
[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

Come on and take it back for us

No, I'll take it back now


Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 4]
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

Mt. Joy,sad,"There's two ways this goes now
As our love comes crashing down
You could be the flame that burns out
Or you could turn and burn it down
And in my life I've found the sweetest killers hanging around
Waiting on your undeserving lips to smile on a life you know exists


So if you worry, don't worry 'bout me
I always wanted you to see
The California coastline on your own time
And if you worry, don't worry 'bout me
I always wanted to be free

If I don't wake up trace me on the asphalt
Let the morning rain wash me away
There's two ways this goes now
As our love comes crashing down
You could be the flame that burns out
Or you could turn and burn it down
And look at what you have now
The silver dagger in your mouth
Waiting on the words to come down
That this ain't working out

Twenty-two, five, lil' rico got him pure
I was standin' on the block tryna get a rack to buy a Buick
Now I'm trim, Lamborghini Boy, I know you seen that Urus
If I ever run into your bitch, your love life gon' be ruined
Take a break, but ain't gon' never gonna stop, this shit to be continued
From a traphouse, beatin' down the doors to packin' out the venue
When they catch him, they gon' eat him up, I put him on the menu
Put piranhas on yo ass, three, four hundred on your ass
Get the switch, she actin' bad, like your mama on your ass
My first deal was worth a couple mil', I still was sellin' bags
Maggot bitches trying to tackle me, I'm stiff armin' they ass
Google said my net worth five mil', I got that shit in cash
Everyday my life go up and up, it's hard for me to get mad
I'm established, I might pop out, Cactus Jack on like I'm Travis
They act happy, but as soon as you turn your back, they try to stab you
I done manifested this shit, as soon as I see it I'm gonna grab it
I act humble, but you can go and check my numbers, I ain't average
I be hearin' shit, but you old washed up niggas, I be laughin'
You don't hear nothing 'bout my young niggas, cause they know to put on a mask

And all that I could say was

Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night
I remember where we started, I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You didn't give a reason, I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I


Well, I bought a pen and I turned the page
Then I wrote about how I wish you'd stayed
I said all the things that I never got to say
Maybe when it's done, I will feel okay


That she had grown so distant
And that her love had shifted
I wish she felt the same

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now

Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows

God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread

We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall

When love and trust are gone

Slide through the 8th, leave a Gz on his back
They not 'ootin', they just gettin' boomed
Luchi and Dubskii got knocked out they shoes
Know some opps that got put in the news
If they ain't dead yet, then that pack comin' soon
If I gotta choose, you know i'ma boom

Drive-By Truckers,sad,"Goddamn Lonely Love LyricsI got green and I got blues
And every day there's a little less difference between the two
So I belly up and disappear
Well I ain't really drowning cause I see the beach from here
I could take a Greyhound home
But when I got there you’d be gone
Along with everything a home is made up of
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
Sister, listen to what your daddy says
Don't be ashamed of things that hide behind your dress
Belly up and arch your back
Well I ain't really falling asleep; I'm fading to black
You could come to me by plane
But that wouldn't be the same
As that old motel room in Texarkana was
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love

Stop me if you've heard this one before:
A man walks into a bar
And leaves before his ashes hit the floor
Stop me if I ever get that far
The sun's a desperate star
That burns like every single one before

And I could find another dream
One that keeps me warm and clean
But I ain't dreamin' anymore, girl, I'm waking up
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take everything you got

But I used to be a welder by trade
Used to work by the water where the ships get made
But no ship yard will take me now

And a kid that doesn't call
And every month I'm caught short
With my fucking child support
And the court says that I'm reckless and irresponsible
Cause it was never part of the plan
To be a middle aged man
To be sat outside a hostel, shaking strangers hands
But I've drunk away my wealth
I'm a picture of bad health
And I'm a shadow of a shadow of a former self

I wanna see your face, I got some things to say
Was just a week ago, you said, ""I love you, girl""
I said, ""I love you more""
Then a breath, a pause, you said, ""If you say so""

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion


What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer


I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere


What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

[Verse 4]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending


Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care

Passenger,sad,"Well, last night I couldn't sleep
I got up and started walking
Down to the end of my street
And on into town

Well I had no one to meet
And I had no taste for talking
Seems I'm talking my whole life
It's time I listen now

Well I walk passed the late night boys
With their bottles in their doorways
And I walk passed the business men
Sleeping like babies in their cars
And I thought to myself, ""Oh, son
You may be lost in more ways than one""
But I've a feeling that it's more fun
Than knowing exactly where you are
Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
I'll keep on walking
Oh, I'll keep on walking
Until I find that old love or that old love comes to find me

Well, I walked into the morning and felt the warm sunlight forming on my shoulders
'Cos it hit me with no warning like a summer sky storming in my lungs
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by?
They'll do anything to make themselves look older
While the women spend their money on anything that makes them look young

Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Oh, I'll keep on walking
Well, I'll keep on walking

So keep your eyes set on the horizon
On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining
Well I know it'd find you soon
Cause I have sailed a thousand ships to you
But my messages don't seem to make it through

[Verse 2]
Well I would bring your morning coffee
Then I'd wrap you up in me (me)
Deedeedee
I'd kiss your belly and your shoulders
Cover blankets on our feet
But slow down there's some sort of blessing here
But you've gone and missed your cue

[Chorus]
So keep your eyes set on the horizon
On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining
Well I know it'll find you soon
Cause I have sailed a thousand ships to you
But my messages don't seem to make it through

And I know those pretty actresses are calling your name

Regina Spektor,sad,"You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met


Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread
And went right back to bed
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met


Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
Told me I was beautiful
And came into my bed
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me 'til the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me 'til the morning light


Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread
And went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once

Like, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you, God sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Counting your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your strain, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed, it grows some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessin' that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heartbeat, and you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

Precious little one
It’s your lucky break!
All your worries are in the past!

I get you’re a nun
But for heaven’s sake!
Drop it, need your bathroom, fast!
You’ve been through so much!
Peril, demons, pain!
This life’s easy and quite simple!

Odd you knew so much
But let me refrain
I just wanna go tinkle

There’ll be time for your little bathroom trip
Once you join us and convert!
Have a splash of Holy Water!

Gonna pass, if I have another sip
Think my bladder’s gonna burst!
Sitting on the border!
You don’t drink it, courses through ya!
Just a littlе dab’ll do ya!
Take the vow, you’ll understand
And bе reborn a pious man!
So use that voice to sweetly croon
A bucketful of hymnal tunes!
And fill the last spot on my choir
Help the message spread, inspire!

Sounds like pretty awful luck
To join a choir and get stuck
Just filling out a bigger sound
Without the fame and cash abound
I’ll need to treat The Girlfriend right
And get through all my rapping fights
So sorry, lady, it’s a no
Now where’s the stall, I gotta go!
You might also likeDon’t let greed and lust
Overtake your mind!
Look in your heart and do what’s right!

Girl, this song’s a bust!
Even if you’re kind
I can’t throw away this fight!

I can’t change your act
I won’t bend you will
But remember, God’s watching you!

I would make comebacks
But my bladder’s filled
Where’s that bathroom? I can’t go in the pews!





Worship

You should know by now
Outside of this chapel
Lies a world of sin and taboo!
Trust me, I’m aware
There’s a few bad apples
But there’s lots of good too!
But the rot’ll spread
And you won’t escape it!
If you leave here unconverted

Got the rappin’ skills
That I need to make it
In one piece, don’t be alerted!

Think of how your vocals fell flat
When a giant lemon monster tried to rend your flesh and eat it?

Whoa, whoa, how’d you know about that?
Guess we needed that big scary eyeball monster to defeat it…

Or when you were both surrounded
By a company of tankmen in the desert, trembling in fear?
OK, guess your fears are founded
But I got one little question: how’d you see that here?

I am but God’s all-seeing servant!

Kinda creepy you’re so observant…

You could say that, but know this well
My goal is noble

Noble…

Simple

Simple…

Save your ass from Hell forever!
Hell forever?

Sure, I’m not perfect, but I’m no monster…

Play it safe, let me be your sponsor...

Can’t give up all of my music goals
And let some pushy

Pushy?

Creepy

Creepy?

Nun control my life’s endeavors!
Life’s endeavors
Have a simple point:
Worship God and you’ll join
Him in Heaven, ever-happy!

Can’t just live to die!
I don’t play by God’s whims!
That life sounds real crappy!
You won’t live at all
Without God’s protection
Battling the hordes like you’ve been!

Seems you’re scared to lose
Drop the interjections
Ain’t no fight this boyfriend can’t win!

Take a look into your future!Killer clowns with horrid sounds and fiends who want your soul attacking!

Sure, I might end up in sutures
But I’ll fight on, sing so hard they lose their instrumental backing!

But they won’t just stop with singing!Ne’er-do-wells have secret spells to turn your very words against you!

If they want a fight, then bring it!
I got more than vocal cords to beat ‘em and pull through!

You have no reason to suffer!
God can vanquish all your troubles, all you gotta do is let Him!

Don't need no religious buffer!
Got my girlfriend, got my mic, got everything I need, forget Him!

You would knowingly face danger
All alone when you don't have to, just because you don't want guidance?

Pretty used to rappin’ strangers
Comin’ at me, keeps life spicy, give freedom a chance!
Chance!





Zavodila

Small man with tiny voice
Fighting Ruv is poor choice
Whoa, everything’s shakin’!
Windows and doors breakin’!
Walls crack from voice effects
Join quickly, or you’re next

Shatter this place all night
Won’t join without a fight!

That is not an issue, for Sarvente I would massacre
Your fate was sealed in stone the instant you think to make ass of her
I tie your arms in pretzel and I lock you in confession room
And check to see if you are pious choir boy next June!

Gotta catch me if you’re gonna live up to those empty threats!
My skin is slicker than my rhymes, ain’t no one out there grabbed me yet!
I’ll rap around your head so quick, you’ll get confused and have no clue
I locked you in the room myself, ‘til you confess my rapping beat you!

Small one, you cannot run
If I wish to, I will take you
Into custody of church
If you won’t live an honest life, I will break you
Face it, if you don't quit
You won’t have a church to live in!
How are you gonna save anyone
When there's nowhere their sins are forgiven?
Fair point, we need this joint
Good thing I control my vocals
With small change, I shatter lungs instead
You can be warning to no-good locals

Hold on! That’s way far-gone!
I need my lungs to inspire!
Plus it seems you'd crush Sarvente’s dreams
If I could never sing in her choir!

Fine, I restructure goal
So Sarv can save your soul
I’m caring, strong, and brave
What could you need to save?
I gave tip previously
So, Boyfriend, you tell me

Wait, don’t tell me it’s true...
I got that note from you?!

“Help! I’m tortured by a demon!”
“Love my date, her dad’s a nightmare!”

Hey, don’t act like I was screamin’!
Didn’t actually wanna come here!

Oh, you’re turning pink as salmon
Where’d that strong and brave man go to?

Maybe you should reexamine
What strength means from what I’ve lived through!

Tell me, what would Girlfriend say
If I told her your full confession?

Do you think you’re gonna sway
Me to your side with blackmail questions?

I don’t think you understand
The lengths I’d go to make Sarv happy…
Thought you were God’s servant, man!
All of this Sarv talk sounds real sappy…
No, is nothing like that! Is just lifelong tie...
I protect her, she looks after me
If we keep doing that, we never die!
Oh, is that really all? Then I'm sure she'd love to find
That God and souls are just a job to you
And she holds the number-one spot in your mind?
I can’t distract her from her life's work, so don’t you squeal!
I know you have dark secrets of your own
So shut up quickly and my lips are sealed!

Sounds like a deal to me
Let me add one quid pro quo
Just point me to the bathroom in this place
I'll get out of your hair, and she'll never know!



Gospel

(Spoken)

Oh, by the way, no human’s ever been able to keep up with this one for more than a couple of seconds, so I’ve already won
Is that so? Hahah… You might be fast… but I’ve mastered an almost-unbeatable technique!

(Sung)

God in heaven please forgive me
For what this boy’s made me do
I promise I’ll extract his soul
And quickly give it back to you!

So look away, avert your gaze
Lest you behold a gruesome fate
As your eternal servant
Wipes the floor with this unholy ingrate!

Don’tcha think that maybe if you
Fear that God might disapprove
Of what you plan to do to me
You oughta make a different move?

My girlfriend might be devilishly cute
But I know she ain’t schemin’
C’mon, give me all you got
You’re up against a real speed demon!

If you want to fight and struggle
For your freedom, be my guest
I’ll bind your mind like Isaac’s body
Knowing that it's for the best!

Your soul is twisted, broken, tainted
Dominated, weak, dependent
You can't fix it, hand it to your savior
Let Sarvente mend it!

Givin’ up my soul to someone
Like you isn't that appealing
Didn't let me use the bathroom
Called me dumb, dismiss my feelings!

Speak like you're a flawless saint
But all your words are cruel and hollow!
If you wanna be a savior
Be a nun folks want to follow!

Don’t you know I’ve saved hundreds before?

Are they even alive anymore?

Most are in heaven, they live devout lives thanks to me!
Ask God yourself when you get up there, and you'll quickly see!

I'm in no rush to give up the ghost and pass away...
Got a lifetime left to pass the gates on my judgement day!

Living as you are right now
Will surely lead you into sinning
You’ll be worse off than you would be
If you died at your beginning!

Wait a second, are you saying
I’m more sinful than a baby?
Those things don’t have morals yet at all
So reconsider, maybe?

All you've done since you arrived
Is whine about your precious toilet
Sounds real immature to me
You could have joined and went, you spoiled it!

I still gotta tinkle, though…

This ain’t the time and place, you know!

You see, this is the reason I won’t let my soul go!

You keep rejecting your life’s goal in the long run!

You keep projecting your own dreams on everyone!

It’s the right dream!
All you stupid humans
Think eternity is far away
‘Til it’s right there in your face!

Get you want me
Born again into a new man
But you suck today
Even if your heart’s in the right place!

Why won’t you budge? Take the love I can never feel!
Is heaven holding a grudge with you, what’s the deal?
Just a little violence
Didn’t hurt them too much
Won’t hurt you a bit if
You give me that soul of yours now!

I’m afraid to say
You might be losing your touch
You keep laying waste to
All your holy duties and vows!

I’ve been saving souls for eons, pardon me if I get rude
When shrimpy little sacrilegious punks like you have attitudes!
So screw the vows, forget the rules, the only thing that works is fear!
What will it take to make you break? Let’s find the answer, right now, right here!
Nothin’ left to scare me, my life’s chock full of disasters
Every time I think it’s over, I live through it and rap even faster!
Made me tough and built me up, I’m not a wimp, I’m a survivor
And I’m a huge hit online with lots of patrons and subscribers!

No one wants to listen to the word of God these days, they’d rather
Pledge their lives in service of the followings that they can gather!
Bet you’d change your tune real quick if you saw your eternal fate
So I’ll give you a little sample, open the infernal gate!

Slow down, lady! Doesn’t seem appropriate to put me through Hell
Just ‘cos I’m not that religious, that’s not gonna work out too well!
You’ll just leak some fire and a couple brimstones in the parish!
Burn the floors and melt the walls, this place will look defaced and garish!

It’s too late, behold eternal torture!
Look upon your future and despair, the Boyfriend!
Scream!
In a bed of thorns while demons poke at you
And you wish you weren’t living!

Endless pain, no reprieve
And no way to get out, can’t leave
Would you take this end, or do you
Have some sins that need forgiving?

It’s not too late, change your fate with me
And this glimpse will be all you’ll ever see!

Is that all, some demons and some fire?
Poking me and tying me to painful bedding?
Hah!
That was Tuesday last week when the Dearests tested
My reflexes and my cunning!

Things were tense, made no sense
But I dodged with all of my strength
With assistance from The Girlfriend
Made it out alive, looked stunning!

Give it up, there’s nothin’ that’s too hard
For me to overcome when Girlfriend’s my guard!
I don’t get it, that was Hell. I showed you Hell and you’re still fearless!
Nobody that’s gone this far has ever held up, God, you’re peerless…
Won’t do any more than that to take your soul, congrats, you win it
Could just cheat and warp your mind, but even demons have their limits...

I told ya!
Nothin’s gonna get to me if I’ve got Girlfriend by my side
I know that things’ll work out fine with her love when I’m terrified!
The love you feel for God’s immense, I can’t deny that, sure you mean well
But you won’t win much of His if you keep making portals to Hell!

Your enthusiasm’s awful, God, I hate it, what a fool
You think I’ll ever win His love when He makes all of heaven’s rules?
You’re free, now go, get off my church, I’ll take a week to rest and cry
Then dust myself off, fake a smile, give this thing another try

Sarvente…
In the end, it doesn’t matter what you do, you’re in a loop
Of greeting, begging, forcing, pushing people to join in your troupe
So I’ll just leave and live my life, I really am a lucky one
To have someone that cares for me despite the stupid things I’ve always done…
In the end, it doesn’t matter what I do, I’m in a loop

Climbing that tree baby I did it first yeah
Guess the apple really falls farther than I though
Asking how the fuck I'm making money?
Like you can't see that I'm hot
Nah you jealous so you act like you forgot
If you a hating bitch, come on then try it
If you got a problem, say it since you spite me
And your insta says public figure.. that's unlikely
You a gossip girl, get a grip but stop prying

Before hoes start dying

And these bitches wanna look like me
Know they can't and couldn't ride a hook like me
Know all these bitches try so hard tryna dislike me

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before (Listened to before)
I swear you've taught me everything I know (Everything I know)
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you, through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you, through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you (As long as it's okay)

I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soul
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it

Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't gеt it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends

I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA, always keep it a hunnid K
Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning

Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""

The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots

Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government

But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got

And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""

Ruth B.,sad,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free


He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...


I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

The Lumineers,sad,"I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time


While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you


But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time


And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part


I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

Eminem,good-vibes,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there
[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)

Come take my hand (Come take my hand)

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)

Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover


Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide


And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier
To pretend that you were just some lover

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through

Passenger,sad,"You've walked a long road and you've worn it well
You stitched yourself up when you fell
Keep your memories in jars
Carry secrets and scars beneath your shell
You've seen some good days and some bad ones too
You weave through fashion and trend
You've seen the sun rise on an ocean blue
You've seen it set for the dearest of friends


You found faith but you chose to doubt it
You found love but you left without it
Now you don't want to talk about it

You travelled down through foreign lands
Touched mountain tops and golden sands
Seen pyramids and temples made of stone
Keep seashells in a cashmere scarf
A treasured book of photographs
In every single one you stand alone
You've seen Vienna and the Berlin wall
As you watch the decades fall
The letters that you wrote never made it home
Your birthdays flew past like June
With Christmas days in hotel rooms
And New Year's eve with people you don't know


You built friendships but they sailed without you
You never meant it and that's why they doubt you
And they don't ever talk about you


You're older than you used to be
The mirror weaves a tapestry
Of lines that dance and shimmer 'round your eyes
You stare back at a man, forever holding out his hand
As if the answer is gonna fall out of the sky

Donne-toi juste à moi, donne-toi juste à moi, donne-toi juste à moi, c'est tout ce que je veux
Et si ce qu'ils disent est vrai, si c'est vrai, je pourrais me donner à toi
On peut parler de beaucoup de chose, je garantie que je peux te soutenir
Je pense que je peux te bluffer, dépêche-toi, j'attends devant

[Couplet 2 : Camila]
Tout dépend de toi, tout dépend de toi, tout dépend de toi, alors que voudrais-tu faire?
Et si tu n'as pas d'idée, pas d'idée, je te dirais quoi faire
Vas-y fort juste parce que, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas quand c'est trop doux
J'aime un peu de rudesse, pas de trop, mais peut-être juste assez

Much colder than I thought, even in the month of June
No communication makes you feel so alone
All we need is patience in which I've never really known

It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try, you know I can't deny

Throwing out the questions, waiting for the right reply

Passenger,sad,"I walked the steps of my father today
Worked till I froze and my face turned grey
And all of my fingers calloused and worn to the bone
And I felt like a child in a world full of men
Trying to capture that something again
Strong as an ox but slowly turning to stone

Walking away from this room dark and grey
Smoke hangs in clouds and the old echo plays

And the music is soft
And the voice it is hushed
And the boy he has loved
And the man he has lost
And I walk out in the rain
All over again

I felt the touch of my mother today
Gently pushing me forward again
Closing my eyes but still feeling the way
And I'm clutching at fingers through crumples & creases
I came to my senses it cut me to pieces
'Cause I needed more but I was pulling away

Walking alone with these legs made of stone
I'm almost dry and I'm almost home

Where the photographs smile
And I'm still someone's child
And my place it is set
So I'll stay for a while

Till I walk out in the rain
Like water would stain
And I'm born all over again

Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof

Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

Passenger,sad,"Four horses pull a carriage through an empty street
And though the day is cold & still they are not
Breathing They make no sound at all

As easily as water finds its way to ground
They bleed into the brick and are gone

And I have seen what I have seen as I fall
Like a whisper in the dome of St Paul
The drowning man's forgot what he's called
But he illuminates our town for us all
Walk up the narrow staircase from the balcony
And at the top go out and grip the golden railing
The view from up here really takes your breath away
You step out of of your skin and you're gone

So follow me down to the riverside, honey
We can pack our bags and take all our money
We can fly away, we can fly away

Take me down to the railway tracks
We can cross the bridge where the sun sets, baby
We can fly away, we can fly away

Take me down, take me down
Fly away, fly away

The day is cold and still and there's no reason
To make a sound at all
As easily as water finds its way to ground

And I have seen what I have seen as I fall
Like a whisper in the dome of St Paul

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it


Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides


I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way


Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, ""Princess and the face scar""
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2]
And I will stay up through the night
Yeah, let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust

Rascal Flatts,sad,"I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is, but I know it's amazing
You save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought


It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today

You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
It's not gonna wait 'til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break


It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today

Oh, oh, oh oh oh

I know it feels like today, I'm sure

The one thing I'm wishing

Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster

So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace

Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

Where everything is black and white

Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

Death Cab for Cutie,sad,"Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark


If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back


If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark


You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms


And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs

I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here?
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People staring at me while I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them

Woah, woah, I'd fly away
[Verse 2]
No one knew how low I was feeling
I was scared to reach for it all
Knowing I was herе for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So whеre do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass is greener than it is

I would just fly, fly away

Well I see the girl running
With no shoes on her feet
Jumping shade to shadow
In this deafening heat

And I hear the trains coming
And the drunk man singing on the street
And the fan on the ceiling
Reeling

And I dream silent movies
Black and white memories I suppose

Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes

So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""

It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you

Demi Lovato,good-vibes,"You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known, maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door (Hey)
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known, I guess you should've known
That I would talk, I would talk

But, even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies

I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh, no, not anymore, oh, no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go
Now if we meet out on the street, I won't be running scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
And make you understand, and make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

Yeah, listen up
Hey, hey, never look back
Dumbstruck boy, ego intact
Look, boy, why you so mad?
Second-guessin', but should've hit that
Hey, Demi, you picked the wrong lover
Should've picked that one, he's cuter than the other

'Til someone comes along and spots one

They say it's the hardest step
But it's the first one of many

And I can't seem to take any

For the free cup of tea and the biscut
And make my way towards the door
But I don't think I can risk it
'Cause I never wanted to stay
But the morning came so soon
And we all know the words
But we just sing them out of tune

'Cause I had my first drink when I was fourteen
And I knew that I was in trouble
'Cause I woke up the next morning
With my face down in the rubble
And everyone was drinking singles
I pour myself a double
I just needed a little bit more

And now I'm sitting here with my name badge
And I'm listening to the same sad stories
About their old dads
Who're making all the same
Bad turning's at their crossroads
And drowning all their sorrows
Without any lifeguard around

Oh no, I never wanted to stay

And oh, we all know the words
But we just sing them out of tune

Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street


And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you


And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise

She's a part of the cheer team
Top of her class and she's prom queen
When we study chemistry
She unbuttons her blouse

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I got a secret I must confess
It's not her laugh or the way she'd dress
She's not the reason I've been thinking 'bout love
Every weekend when we hangout
I lose my cool when he's around
And I don't know if this is just a crush
How do I find the words to tell her?

I'm in love with Stacy's brother

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna stay the night at Stacy's
Don't know why my heart's been racin'
'Cause the whole school thinks we're gonna hit first base
She's coming back from her cheer meet
Told me to study for biology
'Cause she wants to show me how to get an A

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I got a secret I must admit
It's not her lips I want to kiss
She's not the reason for the bruises 'round my neck
Every weekend I'm sneaking out
Through the window of her house
And the truth is it ain't Stacy I undressed
How do I find the words to tell her?

And I've sat on my secrets for years

My composure won't slip
And I've hidden each silent salty tear
I sit on this table for one
And I have been here before

But I wouldn't ask for more

And my mother she taught me to write
And my father he taught me his trade
And I wish that they could both be here tonight

Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burnin' heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her


Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did


When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby, and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her111",0

It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
But it doesn’t feel right in her bed (But I love it)
It hurts to know

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry & Deion Reverie]
Yeah, if only I knew to love you, I would lose me
Would wake up just to go back asleep
I hope you and him live happily
But the memories, girl, you gon' have to keep
All the lies that you told me are on repeat
I don't know what’s real, you lie through your teeth
If I could take the feelings that I had for you
Just like our pics, I'd press delete
I've been contemplatin' a hundred times
About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time
But you can never say I didn't fucking try
What you meant to me is what I mean to art
Was real with you from the fuckin' start
You played games with my fuckin' heart
And after you, I fell a-fuckin'-part, damn
I know we weren’t perfect, I guess I thought we were worth it
I guess your love was uncertain, you’re busy at the club flirtin'
Friends just keep feedin’ you bourbon
Car smellin' like his cologne and your weed
For months I would think, ""Is he better than me?""
I know that he can't love you better than me
I wonder, was it your intention to cheat?
Can't believe I believed you
Keep telling myself I don’t need you
When talking to her, I just see you
Alone, but surrounded by people
Maybe one day you'll change, and he'll reap the benefits
'Cause all you left me were questions and pain
Don't know why I care if you're feelin' the same
I need to just get you up out of my brain (It hurts to know)

You're not the you you would claim
You're not the person I met
Don't know the you you became
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)
And I tried to give you a chance
But things were never the same
I ended up all alone
You ended up with a lame
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)

Still, you're who my family adores
Maybe that's why it's hard to ignore you
After all of the time that we spent
Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I woulda done anything for you (It hurts to know)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing, but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach (It hurts to know)
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep tellin' myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (It hurts to know)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest
And it's sad to believe that a picture with me
Is a picture of you and an ex
You should know that it takes everything within me

No one's said they've seen him

She looks back to the window, suddenly the phone rings
A voice says something's happened
That she should come right now
Her mind goes to December, she thinks of when he asked her
He bent down on his knees first
And he said

I want you forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, forever and always


She pulls up to the entrance, she walks right to the front desk
They lead her down a million halls
A maze that's never-ending
They talk about what happened but she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face

She sits by his bedside, holds his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have and the good life
The house on the hillside
Where they would stay


Stay there forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, and always remember
Whether rich or for poor, or for better
We'll still love each other, forever and always

I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

The bezel is Tiffany stamped
Don't grip on my hand
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance

They pay me to show you I'll do it again

Daughter,sad,"Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line


And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day, we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there


And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this home


And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it


Well, I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget
And my eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest


And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale, too
And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR
'Cause I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me, and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now

Ed Sheeran,sad,"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you


We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel

Passenger,sad,"Oh, well, he’s been collecting since the age of nine
Every shiny bullet that he could find
Built himself a house with the wooden floors
Put the shiny bullets in a chest of drawers


Well, his wife’s long gone and the kids are grown
The trees, they fall down on their own
Memories fade like an old slideshow
But the bullets still shine like coins in the snow

Well, one day he took himself into town
When the men with the truck, well, they came around
They took the television and the gun from the wall
Oh, and almost every bullet from the chest of drawers
Oh, no, oh

[Verse 4]
Well, he came back home, found the house in a mess
Run into the bedroom and the old brown chest
Well, he didn’t care much for the VCR
But he cried for the space where the bullets were

[Verse 5]
Well, the men took the truck down into town
And they sold all the silver they had found
But they couldn't sell the bullets 'cause they weren't live rounds
So they dug a big hole, put the bullets in the ground
Oh-oh-oh, no, oh-oh, I...


Well, he doesn't leave the house much anymore

Fleurs Douces,sad,"Heart to a Stranger LyricsI gave my heart to a stranger
Father forgive me for it
But I don't want it back
If this pain is what it means to have it
Then I'd rather be without it
Gave away my heart to a stranger

If time is bendable
Then why do years go by so slow?
As if it wants to remember
All the mistakes
The foreign places
A bitter taste
And all the lonely days
I tried to stay upright
But it all went wrong
Gave my heart to a stranger
Father forgive me for it
But I don't want it back
If this pain is what it means to have it
Then I'd rathеr be without it
Gave away my heart to a strangеr

Footsteps outside the door
My head against the bathroom floor
Tryna distract me from feeling
Now in hindsight
No never mind
It’s too late now
To go back in time
Call it lesson learned
Cause learned how to lose

I gave my heart to a stranger
Father forgive me for it
But I don't want it back
If this pain is what it means to have it
Then I'd rather be without it

The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again


'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah

Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get

But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone

Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go

And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane

Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

Cecily,good-vibes,"The Palace of Art LyricsI built my soul a lordly pleasure-house
Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.
I said, ""O Soul, make merry and carouse,
Dear soul, for all is well"".
A huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish'd brass,
I chose. The ranged ramparts bright
From level meadow-bases of deep grass
Suddenly scaled the light.
Thereon I built it firm. Of ledge or shelf
The rock rose clear, or winding stair.
My soul would live alone unto herself
In her high palace there.
And ""while the world runs round and round,""
I said, ""Reign thou apart, a quiet king,
Still as, while Saturn whirls, his stedfast shade
Sleeps on his luminous ring.""
To which my soul made answer readily:
""Trust me, in bliss I shall abide
In this great mansion, that is built for me,
So royal-rich and wide""
...
Four courts I made, East, West and South and North,
In each a squared lawn, wherefrom
The golden gorge of dragons spouted forth
A flood of fountain-foam.
And round the cool green courts there ran a row
Of cloisters, branch'd like mighty woods,
Echoing all night to that sonorous flow
Of spouted fountain-floods.
And round the roofs a gilded gallery
That lent broad verge to distant lands,
Far as the wild swan wings, to where the sky
Dipt down to sea and sands.
From those four jets four currents in one swell
Across the mountain stream'd below
In misty folds, that floating as they fell
Lit up a torrent-bow.
And high on every peak a statue seem'd
To hang on tiptoe, tossing up
A cloud of incense of all odour steam'd
From out a golden cup.
So that she thought, ""And who shall gaze upon
My palace with unblinded eyes,
While this great bow will waver in the sun,
And that sweet incense rise?""
For that sweet incense rose and never fail'd,
And, while day sank or mounted higher,
The light aerial gallery, golden-rail'd,
Burnt like a fringe of fire.
Likewise the deep-set windows, stain'd and traced,
Would seem slow-flaming crimson fires
From shadow'd grots of arches interlaced,
And tipt with frost-like spires.
...
Full of long-sounding corridors it was,
That over-vaulted grateful gloom,
Thro' which the livelong day my soul did pass,
Well-pleased, from room to room.
Full of great rooms and small the palace stood,
All various, each a perfect whole
From living Nature, fit for every mood
And change of my still soul.
For some were hung with arras green and blue,
Showing a gaudy summer-morn,
Where with puff'd cheek the belted hunter blew
His wreathed bugle-horn.
One seem'd all dark and red ­ a tract of sand,
And some one pacing there alone,
Who paced for ever in a glimmering land,
Lit with a low large moon.
One show'd an iron coast and angry waves.
You seem'd to hear them climb and fall
And roar rock-thwarted under bellowing caves,
Beneath the windy wall.
And one, a full-fed river winding slow
By herds upon an endless plain,
The ragged rims of thunder brooding low,
With shadow-streaks of rain.
And one, the reapers at their sultry toil.
In front they bound the sheaves.
Behind Were realms of upland, prodigal in oil,
And hoary to the wind.
And one, a foreground black with stones and slags,
Beyond, a line of heights, and higher
All barr'd with long white cloud the scornful crags,
And highest, snow and fire.
And one, an English home ­ gray twilight pour'd
On dewy pastures, dewy trees,
Softer than sleep ­ all things in order stored,
A haunt of ancient Peace.
Nor these alone, but every landscape fair,
As fit for every mood of mind,
Or gay, or grave, or sweet, or stern, was there,
Not less than truth design'd.
...
Or the maid-mother by a crucifix,
In tracts of pasture sunny-warm,
Beneath branch-work of costly sardonyx
Sat smiling, babe in arm.
Or in a clear-wall'd city on the sea,
Near gilded organ-pipes, her hair
Wound with white roses, slept St. Cecily;
An angel look'd at her.
Or thronging all one porch of Paradise,
A group of Houris bow'd to see
The dying Islamite, with hands and eyes
That said, We wait for thee.
Or mythic Uther's deeply-wounded son
In some fair space of sloping greens
Lay, dozing in the vale of Avalon,
And watch'd by weeping queens.
Or hollowing one hand against his ear,
To list a foot-fall, ere he saw
The wood-nymph, stay'd the Ausonian king to hear
Of wisdom and of law.
Or over hills with peaky tops engrail'd,
And many a tract of palm and rice,
The throne of Indian Cama slowly sail'd
A summer fann'd with spice.
Or sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasp'd,
From off her shoulder backward borne:
From one hand droop'd a crocus: one hand grasp'd
The mild bull's golden horn.
Or else flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh
Half-buried in the Eagle's down,
Sole as a flying star shot thro' the sky
Above 22 the pillar'd town.
Nor 23 these alone: but every legend fair
Which the supreme Caucasian mind
Carved out of Nature for itself, was there,
Not less than life, design'd.
* * * *
Then in the towers I placed great bells that swung,
Moved of themselves, with silver sound;
And with choice paintings of wise men I hung
The royal dais round.
For there was Milton like a seraph strong,
Beside him Shakespeare bland and mild;
And there the world-worn Dante grasp'd his song,
And somewhat grimly smiled.
And there the Ionian father of the rest;
A million wrinkles carved his skin;
A hundred winters snow'd upon his breast,
From cheek and throat and chin.
Above, the fair hall-ceiling stately set
Many an arch high up did lift,
And angels rising and descending met
With interchange of gift.
Below was all mosaic choicely plann'd
With cycles of the human tale
Of this wide world, the times of every land
So wrought, they will not fail.
The people here, a beast of burden slow,
Toil'd onward, prick'd with goads and stings;
Here play'd, a tiger, rolling to and fro
The heads and crowns of kings;
Here rose, an athlete, strong to break or bind
All force in bonds that might endure,
And here once more like some sick man declined,
And trusted any cure.
But over these she trod: and those great bells
Began to chime. She took her throne:
She sat betwixt the shining Oriels,
To sing her songs alone.
And thro' the topmost Oriels' colour'd flame
Two godlike faces gazed below;
Plato the wise, and large-brow'd Verulam,
The first of those who know.
And all those names, that in their motion were
Full-welling fountain-heads of change,
Betwixt the slender shafts were blazon'd fair
In diverse raiment strange:
Thro' which the lights, rose, amber, emerald, blue,
Flush'd in her temples and her eyes,
And from her lips, as morn from Memnon, drew
Rivers of melodies.
No nightingale delighteth to prolong
Her low preamble all alone,
More than my soul to hear her echo'd song
Throb thro' the ribbed stone;
Singing and murmuring in her feastful mirth,
Joying to feel herself alive,
Lord over Nature, Lord of the visible earth,
Lord of the senses five;
Communing with herself: ""All these are mine,
And let the world have peace or wars,
Tis one to me"". She ­ when young night divine
Crown'd dying day with stars,
Making sweet close of his delicious toils ­
Lit light in wreaths and anadems,
And pure quintessences of precious oils
In hollow'd moons of gems,
To mimic heaven; and clapt her hands and cried,
""I marvel if my still delight
In this great house so royal-rich, and wide,
Be flatter'd to the height.
""O all things fair to sate my various eyes!
O shapes and hues that please me well!
O silent faces of the Great and Wise,
My Gods, with whom I dwell!
""O God-like isolation which art mine,
I can but count thee perfect gain,
What time I watch the darkening droves of swine
That range on yonder plain.
""In filthy sloughs they roll a prurient skin,
They graze and wallow, breed and sleep;
And oft some brainless devil enters in,
And drives them to the deep."" 34
Then of the moral instinct would she prate,
And of the rising from the dead,
As hers by right of full-accomplish'd Fate;
And at the last she said:
""I take possession of man's mind and deed.
I care not what the sects may brawl,
I sit as God holding no form of creed,
But contemplating all.""
* * *
Full oft the riddle of the painful earth
Flash'd thro' her as she sat alone,
Yet not the less held she her solemn mirth,
And intellectual throne.
And so she throve and prosper'd: so three years
She prosper'd: on the fourth she fell,
Like Herod, when the shout was in his ears,
Struck thro' with pangs of hell.
Lest she should fail and perish utterly,
God, before whom ever lie bare
The abysmal deeps of Personality,
Plagued her with sore despair.
When she would think, where'er she turn'd her sight,
The airy hand confusion wrought,
Wrote ""Mene, mene,"" and divided quite
The kingdom of her thought.
Deep dread and loathing of her solitude
Fell on her, from which mood was born
Scorn of herself; again, from out that mood
Laughter at her self-scorn.
""What! is not this my place of strength,"" she said,
""My spacious mansion built for me,
Whereof the strong foundation-stones were laid
Since my first memory? ""
But in dark corners of her palace stood
Uncertain shapes; and unawares
On white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood,
And horrible nightmares,
And hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame,
And, with dim fretted foreheads all,
On corpses three-months-old at noon she came,
That stood against the wall.
A spot of dull stagnation, without light
Or power of movement, seem'd my soul,
'Mid onward-sloping 4 motions infinite
Making for one sure goal.
A still salt pool, lock'd in with bars of sand;
Left on the shore; that hears all night
The plunging seas draw backward from the land
Their moon-led waters white.
A star that with the choral starry dance
Join'd not, but stood, and standing saw
The hollow orb of moving Circumstance
Roll'd round by one fix'd law.
Back on herself her serpent pride had curl'd.
""No voice,"" she shriek'd in that lone hall,
""No voice breaks thro' the stillness of this world:
One deep, deep silence all!""
She, mouldering with the dull earth's mouldering sod,
Inwrapt tenfold in slothful shame,
Lay there exiled from eternal God,
Lost to her place and name;
And death and life she hated equally,
And nothing saw, for her despair,
But dreadful time, dreadful eternity,
No comfort anywhere;
Remaining utterly confused with fears,
And ever worse with growing time,
And ever unrelieved by dismal tears,
And all alone in crime:
Shut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round
With blackness as a solid wall,
Far off she seem'd to hear the dully sound
Of human footsteps fall.
As in strange lands a traveller walking slow,
In doubt and great perplexity,
A little before moon-rise hears the low
Moan of an unknown sea;
And knows not if it be thunder or a sound
Of rocks thrown down, or one deep cry
Of great wild beasts; then thinketh, ""I have found
A new land, but I die"".
She howl'd aloud, ""I am on fire within.
There comes no murmur of reply.
What is it that will take away my sin,
And save me lest I die?""
So when four years were wholly finished,
She threw her royal robes away.
""Make me a cottage in the vale,"" she said,
""Where I may mourn and pray.
""Yet pull not down my palace towers, that are
So lightly, beautifully built:
Perchance I may return with others there
When I have purged my guilt.""Embed",1

Passenger,sad,"When I was a kid the things I did were hidden under the grid
Young and naive I never believed that love could be so well hid
With regret I'm willing to bet and say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own
[Hook]
Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh no


So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up
When your coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up
You call her in the morning when you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road
Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you want to be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our asses

[Hook]
Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction
There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
Cause all I want to do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh oh

Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

Passenger,sad,"Well the first time that I saw her
Standing in the middle of the road
Eyes as bright as Christmas lights
Wearing someone else’s clothes
I did my best to ignore her
But ignoring my best pretty soon
We spent the night all tangled tight
In an armchair in my friend's front room


I said, ""Darling you know, darling you know I can’t stay
'Cause I've given my heart and my word to a girl far away""
I felt weak as she kissed my cheek, and sighed when I heard her say
""Never knew I could get my heart broken in less than a day""

Oh, and the next time that I saw her
Must have been a year or more
Face stained with mascara
Shiverin' outside my door
I did my best to assure her
But assurance isn't easy to give
If you've never been sure of anything much
You get less so the longer you live


She said, ""Darling you know, darling you know I can’t stay
'Cause I've given my heart and my word to a boy far away""
I spoke soft and pretended to cough, like I didn't care either way
Never knew I could get my heart broken in so many ways


And the last time that I saw her
Standing in the pouring rain
Hair a little shorter
But everything else looked the same
I could'a told her that I adored her
She could'a said she felt the same way

And tell me how we're gonna be together, always?
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever
[Pre-Chorus 1]
(I never thought that anyone) Mmh
Could make me feel this way, uh
(Now that you're here, boy, all I want)
Is just a chance to say


Get out (Leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (Now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her (Loser!) and I wonder (Why?)
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (Waste of time)


Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old

I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

Don't care about religion

Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

The Fray,sad,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears


And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between


And everyone knows I'm in

I'm becoming the part that don't last

In the throw around

Mariah Carey,good-vibes,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
[Verse 2]
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth

But you're too smooth, like a cup full of Ace
Heard you got goals, let me know what I could embrace
Feel your heart cold, tell me what I gotta erase
Got a dark soul, but with you, I kinda feel safe
Never feel out of place
Hit me, I'll be there, quickly
No, it ain't too big, a problem I'll face about you

UnoTime,aggressive,"[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Got there in amazement, first haunted place
That I've ever stayed in all night
Up to this point was just chicken feet, this the real deal
Welcome to the big leagues
Thrill seeker with a video cam in hand
I'll be damned if miss a shot of the century on the count
Of I was unprepared with video photography
So I would be a little bit dumb
If I didn't come with state of the art for the hunt
There's a curse that whoever signs the ledger with full name
Will never be allowed to return from whence they came
So to prove it all wrong, I jotted mine down fast
Put my middle initial between my first and my last
Sign my curse, so I laughed, sign it like an autograph
Even though there’s no way to detect the time stamp
Who am I to believe that she could real
As the camera rolls and records what I feel
[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
This is where my problem begins
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
Cuz you can't check out after you check in
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
I've got to live it up
Even though the deads around
I've got to live it up
Screamin crawlin out of the ground
I've got to live it up
Even though the darks so scare
I've got to live it up
Twist and spin around in the air
I've got to live it up

[Interlude: Demon]
Signing the hotel ledger registry will prove what seems to be a funny hoax after all still what lies ahead just up them winding stairs is sure to be solid proof to any skeptical man

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Up the stairs and I'm climbin it quickly
Hopin' the camera catches everything in between
(I've reached the top now)
I'm in the hallway walkin' and I whip around quick
Cause I swear I heard talkin
And my camera drops and the house, it goes black
All of a sudden I feel a hand on my back
Lights come on, I'm freakin out
I can hear the people walkin on the top of the house
Room flickers with blue light and catchin my attention
I can see the reflection of someone standing there
I got the cam and I'm holdin' it steady
And I'm thinkin I got the pictures of whatever
And I'm outta here
Door opens to an empty room
And consume my inhibition to explore the moon
Was the flickerin light, then I seen in the crack of the door
Alright I gotta make it to the end of the night

The shadow of night left for the piercing morning rain. We've found two thrill seekers ​now bound to this unholy structure. In reality they believe they're still alive. Will continue to attempt to break free from the destiny that cannot be changed

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Covered in shards of glass jumped through the window
And ended up in the lobby hit the floor on my ass
(I got up and brushed off)
Now I'm super confused
I'mma break every window with an effort to get through
Every door locked shut with a skeleton key
As apperisions re-appear, dissapear in front of me
(I'm goin outta my mind)
As the camcorder batteries start to die
I'm the only one in here that's still alive
There's a lady in all white floatin' down the hall
And says ""welcome home sweety"" as her head falls off
That has turned the ghost spell home to me
But I'm trapped in krossroads and unable to leave

Blanket of leaves hide the light from the stars
I'll lie awake listening out for cars

He stares through curtains when he talks to the night
I sit and listen for tires on the drive
I keep on waiting and he keep on talking
Just stop him talking, please stop him talking

No, give me silence
Give me silence
Give me silence

Frank Sinatra,good-vibes,"You Make Me Feel So Young LyricsYou make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go and play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots

Akon,good-vibes,"It's only proper that I give y'all the real me

It's only proper that I give y'all the real me
Feds tryna put a bounty on me not guilty
Niggas ran me down, shot me up but couldn't kill me
It's a dirty game so a nigga play it filthy
I used to have my work from my mother like an easter egg
Yayo chopped up on the plate underneath my bed
I was tryna see the bread then I started seeing bread
Met the plug and fеd my people fish like Jеsus did
If you niggas bout pistols nigga I'm talking that fish scale
Got quarters no wish well quickly how that shit sail
Got hit with them big shells how I spit those lines just to get well
Too much pride to let it slide you bitch niggas gon get killed
Hood on like Treyvon, choppa black like Akon
Banana clip up in that bitch, bullets look like crayons
Real nigga from DC, enemies on me deceased
Feds asked who shot me, [?]
Live life how it's fun nigga, retaliate with this gun nigga
Give a fuck if it's broad day, when I see you, youse a done nigga
Leave no survivors I'm a Raleigh [?] till the war is won nigga
Put that on my son nigga ain't no 10th place where I'm from nigga real live!

I've been out here since bout 9, real live I'm bout mine don't go nowhere without mine
Disrespect me and them shots flyin
Enemies get outlined, [?] can't doubt mine
You ain't bussin like [?] bitch nigga men down fire
Cruddy niggas wanna take my life but I won't let them kick me out mine
Got shot but I'm not grieving, you ain't dead so we not even
Play with you nigga not even, on site nigga I'm squeezing
Niggas think it's sweet but they not breathin
On the ground with them shots leakin
Sneak diss on the internet but when I see them in person niggas act [?]
Tough talk I am not seeing
Naw this ain't no diss track
Mishaps turn to dispatch calls run it back put your shit back
Fake shit can't get down with it, don't even come around with it
.40 Glock 30 rounds in it, .40 Glock 30 rounds in it
Cross the line then them rounds spittin, silencer keep the sound in it

It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down

"Julie and the Phantoms Cast, Charlie Gillespie",sad,"First things first
We start the scene in reverse
All of the lines rehearsed
Disappeared from my mind
When things got loud
One of us running out
I should've turned around
But I had too much pride

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No time for goodbyes
Didn't get to apologize
Pieces of a clock that lies broken

If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words ""I love you"" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret are the ones I never meant to leave

Silent days, mysteries and mistakes
Who'd be the first to break?
I guess we're alike that way

Gloria Gaynor,good-vibes,"You can go to Harvard
You can be a pilot
You can be an astronaut
But first, be a woman, ooh ooh...
When you're walking down the street
Show your feminine appeal
Even tho' you're wearing jeans
It's important to be real
You were born to be yourself
So no matter how you feel
If you want to impress the opposite sex
When he takes you for a ride
Let him open you the door
When he asks you for a dance
Let him lead you to the floor
When he kisses you good night
You just leave him wanting more
You can do all you can
Say I am what I am
But first be a woman... oh oh oh oh
When he takes you out to dine
Don't you end up in his bed
Wedding bells will ring in time
Make him dream of you instead
And his passion can be like
All the stories that you've read
He can be Romeo if you act like Juliet
Nowadays it ends too soon
Even tho' it's just begun
You can take him to the moon
He'll leave with the morning sun
So take a lesson from the past
Make him want and make him run...
(You can't be a quarterback
He can't wear a pretty dress
You cannot be Superman
And he's not a shy princess
So why try to be alike
When it's only self defense ?
You've got grace, he's got style
And together you'll rhyme
So remember to be true
To the legend that you are
All the feminine in you
Has worked miracles so far
So head up high and don't be shy
You can reach for any star
You can do all you can...
Say I am what I am
You can be an executive

Eminem,aggressive,"Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)

Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)

While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl

Sun Tzu, nah its me who sons him
This the art of war, we carnivores, we munchin
Run shit, from Van City to Moncton
Consumption, webcam titty productions
Got fam badlands out to the junction
The shaolin monks rollin up to ya function
Put the city on my back from the get go
Lets go ima hold it down for the metro
Killa Cam wit a can full of petrol
Kilograms in the Trans Am, no rental
Bad bitch tryna muck her box like bento
Still she a thot we forgot the memento
No crotch rot, pussy top notch like the tempo
Nice man, ice man with the kempo
10-4, left right hand to the temple
Explode just like coke wit a mentos
Threw bones to Jones Drew but he Bledsoe
I said so, ""I dont give a fuck if you said so""
Oh no young Tay Fode gone schizo
Woods tried to hit him with a hook but he missed tho
In his mind he's a crook wit a pistol
Intertwined with the cook of the crystal
Look blissful but the man sniffed a fistful
Shit's real when ya boy Woods can't sit still
Doc Phil if he popped pills
Killa Croc kill a cop on the dock if he got skill
Flow sick but he not ill Bill-
Wither foes and they got chills, chill (chill, chill)
I got my slong and wontons in ya moms like ton tons
Tay foden he long gone, Cambodia Hong Kong
Shawty lovin me long time, rub and tuggin' me sippin bubbly
I'm flippin' through the channels and waitin' for the discovery

Sho nuff, catch me coolin' in that west end

Both nuts on the boobies of your best friend

Smoke excessive blunts son, we spinnin' like Castro
So send us the cash flow, stop defendin' these assholes

{Verse 2: Haf n' haf}
Yo, I'm next to Woods with some matches and lighters
We set your hood aflame and made you actually brighter, trust
You lookin' lame tryna rap in a cypher
Better luck finding veins with a black widow spider, yup
Either that or a handful of vipers
Aim locked on the Dot with a clan full of snipers
Fans fully hyper for this damn loony writer
Have a blue eyes dragon tail waggin', who's he Kaiba..?
Never pulled the trap card, more in to the Blackstars
Digable Planets, Madvillain, they the rap gods
Flippin' em samples, make examples outta whack frauds
Trippin' dem ankles, 'til I dangle off the backboard
And I ain't even sporty, I like my weed imported
You better axe your mom & dad 'bout me, no Lizzie Borden
I'm just that really focused vocalist in spiffy Jordans
I'm oh so fluid in the studio, no stiff recordings
I made a movies with this cutie and her tits enormous
Your favorite groupie has no booty cuz she skippin' portions
I thought I had this bitch on lock but she want Mr. Foden
They way these women talkin' on em think his dick was golden

We both said we'll build our own empire

You once said we'll build our own empire

One more drink for the very last time, aha-a
You let it fall, I'm brave, I'm leaving tonight
Aha-a, aha-a, aha-a, aha-a
One more drink tonight for the last time

[Bridge: GJan]
You lost me, you're not a hero, you need me
You're always talking about loving and then blah blah blah
Sometimes you want me, nah, sometimes you don‘t
Don't give a fuck about your wishes, you know I'm done
You're living in bubble, shame; I've given up, time for change
Just need a new beginning, new wheels, a new vision
In time I'll get better, for now I'll keep your sweater

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Channeling angels in the new age now

And I just keep watching them for a sign
That you'll be alright

'Cause every time there's a knock on my door
I fall to my hands and knees on the floor
'Cause when your wreckage washes up on my shore
You're not like before

And you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes
But I won't be the debris in your hurricane


You used to be such a delicate kid
A lonely fish in a sea full of squid
So I can't blame you for leaving how you did
You just fell off the grid

Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh

'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon (ayy nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)
I won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level

You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it

Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Sufjan Stevens,sad,"The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all


Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises, I wonder did you love me at all?


The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain riding the wall
Daniel’s message; blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?


Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow


The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart


Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch


Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?

I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers

I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

Started a four letter word but now i'll just forget
And everytime i try to hit you up you're leaving me on read
Where did i go wrong? Is this the end? Is it dead?
I started falling hard for you, a comet rushing down
Lead me on I'm coming through, did you just play around?
Feeling kinda glad that I didn't hit the ground
How come i see you in every town?
And i been feeling numb, starting to overcome
The thought of having you, I'm thinking that it's dumb
Cause what we had is gone, you've left me on the run

This shit's a cycle and it just repeats
Lately my demons been comin' for me
Slipped in my coffin so comfortably
Death is all that has been comforting me
Got a couple problems and all they do is add
So every single day I hide behind my mask
Avoiding every question that they ask
My minds been racin' its run a few laps
I know that she ain't fuckin' coming back
Took my heart and then dashed like a running back
Put the blade to my wrist and then cut em' back
I think it's time that I face the facts
Gotta move on and cut the ties
Burn my mask and it shed the disguise
Rather spark a blunt and then keep on gettin' high
I hate when I'm trapped inside of my mind
I hate all the thoughts that I think
I know that I'm crazy and I need a shrink

To the city, they were mine to keep
Over time, every lock'll change

Passenger,sad,"Well the walls are turning yellow like a smoker's tooth
Cold as a call girl's smile in a phone booth
Baby pigeon starving on the side of the roof
Nothing’s changed

Sometimes words don’t say enough
Sometimes silence says too much
You're too close for comfort but too far too touch
Nothing’s changed

Sun still shining in the play ground
Water still running like a greyhound
My head's still drumming when I lay down
Nothing's changed
We still rattle round the same town
Like two little stones in a coke can
Like two lost kids at a fairground
And nothing’s changed

Car alarms ringing in the dead of the night
Drunk man singing in the morning light
We're too brave to fall but to scared to fight
Nothing’s changed

Sun still shining in the play ground
Water still running like a greyhound
My head's still drumming when I lay down
Nothing's changed

Ain’t no answers blowing in the wind
Ain’t no saint and no sin

'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected

And you reply

Nothing's gonna make me feel this real

When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Taylor Swift,sad,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

Passenger,sad,"Do you remember how this first begun?
Teeth were white and our skin was young
Eyes as bright as the Spanish Sun
We had nothing we could hide
Now my dear we are two golden leaves
Clinging desperately to winter trees
Got up here like a pair of thieves
While the sirens blare outside


What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
But sometimes...

Do you remember how this started out?
So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt
A dirty joke we used to laugh about
But it's not funny any more


I fear I choke unless I spit it out
Still smell of smoke, although the fire's gone out
Can't live with you, but I die without

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for

Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

I really wish that I dressed up a little better

We can't go back again


Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for


Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now

Truth is a suicide

Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine
But you're not one of mine
You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time
Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy
Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly
Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb
Can't even get down from the shit I climb
Yeah, girl, you're my size
Make me tell you one time
We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline
Waitin' for the sunshine
But the sun never shines on me, on me
Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright

Niggas talkin' bare shit about what they gon' do to mine
Aw, now their tongues tied

I would trap until my thumbs cried

There's a hole inside of me and it's shaped like you

[Bridge]
I tried to change your mind, but changed myself instead
I tried to find a God in books I read
Philosophies and poetries could never fill the void inside of me
I stayed alive only to prove to me that I can live without you, I can breathe
The air in places you have never been to shine for people you will never meet but
Every single light inside of me died
When you picked somebody prettier than me
To fill the hole I left inside of you

But I still look at all your photos, so what's the use?
I can do any fucking thing that I want to do
But there's a hole inside of me and it's shaped like you

There's a hole inside of me and it's shaped like you
There's a hole inside of me and it's shaped like you

A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away

Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to
Reach
Was you, right here in front of me

And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (oh.. baby)


It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms this way

Estamos ficando (Shh), esse é o nosso segredo
Esses rappers querem curtir, não podem me alcançar
Você e cinco desses caras não podem me ver
Realmente sou resistente, uma parede, mano, não podem me vencer
O Akademiks sabe que ele não é tão rico quanto eu
Meu parça tá pronto pra comer por vinte peças
Eu não tenho nada pra dizer pra essas miniaturas minhas
Tô pronto pra comprar o contrato de um moleque
Yeah, yeah, que seja, estamos envolvidos nisso
Desaparecendo neles, eles ficaram estranhos comigo
Eu sou o rei substituto, tipo o número um
Eu e o King Pluto, essa é uma tag team suave
Tenho que viver com isso, não consigo acordar disso, isso não é um sonho ruim
Veja como a vida mudou, TVs no chuveiro, eu costumava roubar telas planas

[Saída: Lil Baby]
Shh
Eu sei que eles tão ouvindo, foda-se eles
Saiba que não me perguntam sobre nada
Se eu não estiver em algum lugar ganhando dinheiro, então eu tô destruindo (Fft, fft)
Esse é o som do gatilho
Eu não vou sair sem lutar, eu vou falar essa merda pra você agora
O que quer que eu ganhe, eu vou compartilhar com meu irmão
É assim que a gente aproveita
Se você se ofender, é desse jeito que é

We're livin' that Bobalife
Bo-oh-woah-oh-oh
We're livin' that Bobalife...

[Verse 1: Kelvin Lien/Andrew Fung/David Fung]
Woke up, only one drink on my mind
Not Starbucks, had no coffee beans to grind
It's Taiwanese and it's so good all the time
We living that boba life!
We call it boba, you might call it bubble tea
Fill up a stamp card, might get a couple free
It's Chinese culture to stay with a cup of tea
We updated to pearls and sealing machines
Haters say bobas for girls and kids
'Cause the flavors are fruity and the straws are big
Iced milk with pudding, fruit tea with aloe
Something for everyone, young kids to adults!
[Pre-Hook]
Milk tea or fruit tea
It's got so many calories
Boba means boobies!
We don't even have to try
'Cause we're livin' boba life!

[Verse 2: Priska/Andrew Fung/David Fung]
Freaked out, saw my ex at the boba shop
Checked out his best friend, yeah, I know he's hot
I won't say a word because I'm shy
That's just part of bobalife
Let's head out, it's a boba night
No alcohol it's a sober night
On a search for a boba wife
Wish I could stay here overnight!
Does boba give you cancer?
I think I know the answer! (no!)
Don't believe everything on the internet
It's cassava root, not a cigarette!

I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed

I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat

Ed Sheeran,sad,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend


Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free

Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'

Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa givin' a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors

Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio

Niggas come comical, I fix 'em with the llama too
The money in '85 was so astronomical

Get your gats out, hoods on, masks up
In my dark world fuck boys get touched
I'm much older and colder now
No beat, just release the hounds
I move the social elite from the concrete
It wasn't easy, lotta blood got spilled
Shit got greasy, good men got killed
Somehow I kept my head down, kept moving
A lot had to be shown, it had to be proven
And I'm still alive today
So don't test me in no type of way
You may catch me in the street rolling dolo
Or on the beach in some Ralph Lauren Polo
Or in the next booth over in the hottest club
Or at some hell of a spa getting my feet rubbed

Evanescence,sad,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone


These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me


You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me


These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears

Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
The boy laughed at the spastic
Dancing around in the rain

While laundrettes cleaned clothes
High heels rubbed toes
Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots
Well, they all looked the same

I took myself down to the cafe to find all
The boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
And carved out a poem
Above the urinal that read


Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead


While the evening pulled the moon out of it's packet
Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
We needed a nail
But we tacked it 'til it fell off the wall

With a mattress of leaves
And a blanket of stars
And I'll stitch the words into my heart
With a needle and thread

It can be hard, it can be tough
Chasing greatness can be a lonely road
Sometimes I look back and think
Look how far I've grown
Sometimes I look back and think
Look how far I've flown
Those who fly alone have the strongest wings
I've got a few scars
And if I had to do it again
I wouldn't change a thing

All the cold nights
I learned to fight alone
It made me strong alone

There's no limit to what I'm capable of
Living the life that I love
I had no one so in myself I trust
No one believed in me
But I believed in myself
No one helped me, so I helped myself
Nobody gave me support so I supported myself
I kept going, I kept growing, no slowing down or giving up

I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet


They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many, I know that I'm never
Only they can't see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing


So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named

James Morrison,good-vibes,"I look at you, you bite your tongue
You don't know why or where I'm coming from

We're in the rain still searching for the sun
You think that I wanna run and hide

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered
Well, the time it takes to know someone
It all can change before you know it's gone, for it's gone

Rule 1 gotta get gotta flip gotta find your position while you in a south central state of mind
Another Nip Hussle you will never find
Take a look into my eyes see I forever shine
They should'nt showed me that, true niggas shouldn't have told me that
The streets they know they homies they always try to hold me back

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
It's got a hold on me
The streets won't let me go
I'm in love
It takes it's toll on me
When I try to leave it alone
I can't say no to the gangsta's life
Gotta live a gangstas life

On lock, won't stop, big chain, big watch
Big rims, 3 piece leather seats, no top
Come through the block drive slow
Don't stop, niggas whisper don't talk
Cause they know they get by
From the bottom to the top
I done told ya nigga
Self made getting paid like I'm supposed to nigga
Now the hating is contagious and the only prescription is to load up a clip and give the nigga the business
It happens everyday just for instance
No weapons and no witness that means no conviction
While I'm mixing my patrone in my kitchen
Reminiscing before I make my transition

That you spread out on the table

I just wanna see you upside down

Yeah, you look happier, you do

But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth

The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise

Passenger,sad,"Well she calls me up when she's broken
Says to leave my front door open
I come home to find her smoking
With her eyes all fragile and thin
She's always been hopeless at hoping
Always coped badly with coping
And I never know when she's joking
She never lets anyone in
I know i'm a fool to let her run away with my heart
She'll never tire of these games
Loving her is like playing catch in the dark
I'm a tear drop in an ocean of flames
And we'll drink too much for a Wednesday
She'll ask me why none of her men stay
I tell her just what her friends say
It never goes down too well
And she'll stay here til late in the evening
But she's always arriving or leaving
She never decides to believe in
The people who know her so well
I know i'm a fool to let her run away with my heart

I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club

You keep saying there’s no one

But who keeps calling on your phone?

OneRepublic,sad,"I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you


Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you


Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

Spilled my coffee on my sleeve

And kissed me softly on my cheek

Like a thousand swinging trees
In a forest lying next to stormy seas
Well, we watched the wintry sky
Turn a shade of turquoise, I
Whispered softly, ""I feel lost,""

And curled her lips towards the sky
And said, ""get your map out, then, you knob!""

Ed Sheeran,sad,"Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore


Recently, I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore


And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no

James Arthur,good-vibes," Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did
[Pre-Chorus]
And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts, I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear, I know

All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'

Fearless Soul,good-vibes,"I know how it feels to be abandoned on the street
That sinking feeling being stranded in the deep
We've reached rock bottom hit little, but cold concrete
We'll roam around this stone savannah - anxious souls can't sleep
Nevertheless, I'm living life like a lioness
Lying in hiding 'till the time is right, you might read it as idleness
This isn't nihilistic violence
It's kill or die, no pillow fights though feather's fly, there's no denying this

I try and fit the different pieces - interweave them 'till I finally find a fix
But don't confuse my cold, aloof quite attitude for shyness

I know how it feels to be abandoned on the street
Hanging on for dear life is standard for me
I see in the dark through neon and sparks
And what you say's decay - I call surrealist art
A real fine line between a feline and a fearless heart, I feel it start
Scratch the veneer - reveal the stuff concealed inside
I claimed these streets and made them mine, but they could take me any time
From day to night - a dangerous life, but I ain't the type to stay inside

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far


Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with


Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me

Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything

Beyoncé,sad,"You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier

Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world


Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Got nothing to hide
Now that you're hurting I see
The tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love was like gold to me

But you hold me closer to the light
Wouldn't find the bullet inside
Unless you magnified
But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I, I put my faith inside my hands
'Cause I will be just fine

Imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that


Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, airing on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

Passenger,sad,"Well we’ll kiss for that’s how it begins
We’ll embrace just to warm our skins
I’ll think of her and you’ll think of him
And we’ll talk to keep the silence from our ears
And we’ll laugh because we’re so close to tears
We’re just lonely, you know, that’s why we’re here

'Cause you don’t taste like you should
And you don’t fit in my arms like she would
Lying in the dark, it’s understood:
We are both lost
And we won’t be found
We will wake up with each other in our paws
You cover over white bits like I’ve not seen them before
We’ll say goodbye and then we’ll say no more

'Cause hearts won’t buy love and nor will they sell
And there is no love in this hotel
Though we’re walking home we know too well
We are both lost
We are both lost
And we won’t be found

She was my compass
He was your map
We’ve come too far to be turning back

And we’ll sit on our single beds
Nothing on our hearts and tears on our threads
For we know the last unicorn is dead",0

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left
[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out

There's a golden coin beneath your pillow
There's parachutes above you
And lifeboats below
And a heart that loves you
Yeah, I think you know
There's treasure maps well hidden
And diamonds in the dirt
There's a golden thread weaved into your shirt
There's a kiss for every tear
That rolls down your cheek
And words I shouldn't hear and words you shouldn't speak

So tell me one more lie my dear
Whisper softly so nobody hears
Keep me hanging on for another year

With only hope to keep alive
And only time to kill
There's a fool that loved you
And he loves you still

So tell me one more lie my dear
Whisper softly so nobody hears
Keep me hanging on for another year
Oh, tell me one more lie my dear

Spin me one more tale sweetheart
Weave golden needle and thread through my heart
Whisper all the things you know I long to hear
Oh tell me one more lie my dear",0

Let's go

[Verse 1]
I’m constantly trying to conjure up forbidden flows
Colder than the dope going up that frozen, homeless nose
But it’s hopeless, already hooked, not even focused
I hope you know this, notice these omnipotent verses
Been rehearsing like I died twice, leaving you missing 21 grams
Ironic how I’m making a life, and making it look easy at the same damn time
I really wish you could fuck with me but you’re lines aren’t that nice so
Take a seat in back of the classroom freshman
I ain’t spitting raps no more, I’m spitting school sessions
And concessions be the message fam, this food for thought
Could be a blessing holding many lessons that you’ve lost
And I’m thinking they’re wishing that I would die off
But in that event my power would just blast off
Until I’m bigger than life itself
And you pray every time one of my motherfucking songs come on

C'mon Will, get it together
Isn't it weird that when you're gone you're here forever
Yeah, yeah yeah, forever-ever
Forever

[Verse 2]
I hope the stairway to heaven is stable
Cuz' I'mma have to take a couple trips
Going back and forth like I was playing tennis on the table
Hope you didn’t spend your time tryna get rich
Cuz if you did that then looking back at the past moments you had
It Would almost seem like you were stuck in a trap
Like a rat to a scientist, stuck in a maze going crazy
I’d be amazed if you even know what time it is
It’s time to wake up, we’re letting rectangles be our rulers
Not talking bout the squares in the office either
I am talking treason though, time to let our spirit glow
Didn’t need no endo to see that death is not the end though
Yeah I’m spiritual
Poor soul lets get you out that mental prison
C'mon lets go on a 4th dimension expedition
Where if you want it all you have to do is wish it
I just wish that most could see we’re solely souls existing
As a physical invention of our own perception
Through projection you could learn so many ancient lessons
That the governments tryna keep out of discussion
They’re brainwashing the public
Cuz they know if we knew the truth, there’d be a revolution
They’d have to add a few new pages to the history books
They’d lose a few dollars, and no more fish would bite their hooks
The scholars would be more focused on the future earth pollution
Instead of worrying about their looks like which suit would better suit them
Truth is, I hope the leading corporations hear this
Come around looking to leave me dead with their stainless
Leave me brainless, mistaken, thinking that they’d contain this
Martyr to awaken they hear my words and they’re prayin like

But you are just so sheer
You’re my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much
When you're right here?


When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that’s hard to even comprehend
I won't waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

P!nk,good-vibes,"Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth
[Chorus]
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far

[Verse 2]
So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage

I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line

She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

Good to each other, give it the summer

But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused


You said, ""forever,"" and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry


I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse

Passenger,sad,"Glass was shattered here
Midst the burning smell of fear
Dressed in plain clothes

Bloodstain on the snow
Looks like red wine on the clothes
Of a sailor

She lives in a photograph
Waits for you to make her laugh

Life was shattered here
Midst a thousand mothers’ tears
We’ll need rain clothes

And teardrops melt the snow
Reveal the oil spill in the road
Looks like rainbows

Drunk upon the scaffolding
Swinging around

I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me

Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth

We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust

It erases me and everything I thought we'd be
Back when we gave our promise


I wish you had enough discipline for the both of us
Just because I don't know how to turn off the way I feel
I know you always fell out love so damn easily, but honestly
I don't think you ever had something real
You might also like
Until you met me
Drinks in New York City
Ooh, you looked so pretty
Think I fell in love before I even knew your birthday
Kissed you on our first date
Somehow, I knew someday
This would hurt 'cause I could never let you go


Do you not dream of me?
'Cause I have visions in my sleep
I can't ever find my peace now
Do you wake up alone
And feel an aching in your bones?
Or are you happy without me now?


The first time that you told me
You thought that you loved me
That bar in the city
I thought you were drunk
But I knew deep down that you meant it
Wish that I had said it
I was scared to let it happen
But it happened and now I cannot forget it
Oh, I'll spend my whole life
Missing a part of me, part of me
Oh, I'll spend my whole life

Huh? You can not play, .38, let it spray
That nine milli', thirty clip, let 'em

There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in, there ain't no letting go, letting go
Watch me turn your mind into my home


Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mind-mind games until you lose control
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mind-mind games, mind games, mind games

Now that I'm in, there's no letting go
And your emptiness begins
Once I grip onto your mind and soul
Your brightness starts to dim
Sin after sin you won't feel no more
And you've lost your trust again
I know you wish you could let me know
That you're praying for an end


I can lie to you and tell you
""You can get me out your head""
But I'm lovin' all the pain I'm causing you too much instead, baby


There's another side that you don't know, you don't know

Bitch, you think you know me
Holdin' back the dark force so long, call me Kenobi
Thinkin' I just gotta force this song when I get lonely
Take advantage, say you'll hold me close but never show me
Someone told me you can only disguise and be pretend
The tears manifest sometimes my only friend
You'll never see them again, they hide behind a mask
Thinkin' you're winnin' with all of your grinning but I got the last laugh


I can lie to you and tell you
""I can't get you out my head""
But I'm lovin' watching you think you're controlling me instead, singin'


There's another side that you don't know, you don't know

Eminem,aggressive,"Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left
[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out

She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out

Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up

If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

Alec Benjamin,sad,"She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain


Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young


And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it


Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain
Too young, too young, too young, young


She couldn't be at home in the night time
Because it made her feel alone
But at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us

That's what you said when you left me
I wish I could stay, I wish I could stay
But I need some space and you're in the way


Can you see me? I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me? I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance or selfishness?
You said stay here but I'm running out of air
I hope you know, as I wait I suffocate

I hope you know, I hope you know
The air gets cold when you don't hold me
The sky turns grey, the sky turns grey
The flowers fade and blow away


Can you see me? I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me? I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance or selfishness?
You said stay here but I'm running out of air
I hope you know, as I wait I suffocate


Should I chase you down or should I keep waiting?
Should I move on or should I keep waiting?

En picada, solo rezan para que me estrelle (Huh)
Esos tipos, no quieren verte por última vez
Subirán tres millones de dólares en tus impuestos
Una tina llena de dinero, todavía no puedo relajarme
Los neumáticos giran, Señor, perdóname, soy un pecador
Conquista, divide negros
Lado equivocado de la petición, solo divina ganando
Mejor escucha cuando te digo cómo le pongo tiempo
Por favor, perdóname, Dios lo hizo
Así que déjame en la oscuridad, nadando con los tiburones
Chico drogadicto, gran calma, sigo siendo el jefe más grande
Tengo un kilo en un plato, envíalos en un flete
O puedo ir y comprar un banco, sé que mi dinero está a salvo (Maybach Music)

Dejé el juego de la droga con mi historial limpio, huh
Convertí la cocaína en champán, huh
Yo limpié la madrina con el mismo jabón, huh
Loro y yo hablamos sobre cómo usamos la jerga de la droga, huh
Ahora la hierba está en las tiendas, ¿puedes creer este empate?
Puse mi robo en Forbes, ¿puedes creerle a este tipo?
Luego dijimos, ""Al carajo"", y tomamos la droga pública
Fuera del barro, tienen que enfrentarte ahora, no puedes inventar esta mierda
Júzgalo como lo juzgues, di que vamos a ser corporativos
Nah, solo acorralamos a los chicos con la oficina de la esquina
Estoy en la mesa de mentiras, ¿cuáles son las divisiones?
No esa mesa de mentiras, chico, vivimos esto
Breezy cuál es el negocio
Empujamos a Fenty como Fentanyl, todo es legítimo (Woo)
E estaba diez abajo por esto
Acabamos de recuperar sus diez y luego volvimos como, ""¿Dónde están los intereses?""
Em enciende el O3
Les dejamos hacer las zazas, OG para los OG
Algunos negros nuevos de su bolsillo, hablando exóticos
Apenas has estado en las Bahamas— (Jaja) ese es otro tema
Monograma en mi bolsillo de la alfombra roja
Ves la cara que hice esa noche, la mierda es tan impactante
Las probabilidades no eran buenas, incluso estaríamos vivos
Tengo que estar loco con todos estos negros, nos sorprendió
La mierda es demasiado como crecimos (Crecimos)
Mierda, ni siquiera se siente real para nosotros (Demonios)
OG vendió a esos, lo llamaste capo
Si esos son sus capos de la droga, entonces, ¿quiénes somos nosotros?
Hov es el sueño de un verdadero negro
Mi único objetivo, es hacer que un negro de verdad se sienta visto
A veces, hace que un negro falso odie la vida
Nunca fue mi intención, las consecuencias son de mi forma de vida
La forma en que solíamos jugar con la vida
Ahora tengo cuidado con las sentencias, solo esas rejas me gustan (Woo)
Yo nunca quise ser el custodio estatal (Vamos)
Las leyes del draconiano (Vamos, Hov)
Para los que se casaron con la vida (Vamos), es santo matrimonio y (Vamos)
De alguna manera, superaré en astucia cada caja en la que intentarán arrojarme (Vamos)
Con gran ceremonia y
Folk y me dijeron lo mucho que Caddy hablaba de él
Y tío y eso de Londres, Harold Road, Weston Inn
Hablo a las almas de los hombres
Aquellos ellos están dispuestos a morir por la existencia que este frío mundo ha elegido para ellos
Quitando la nieve de un Timb congelado (Woo)
De ida y vuelta en esta autopista de peaje, realmente les pasó factura
Muchos soldados caídos en estos caminos del pecado
Para los que hacen las leyes, siempre tengo humo para ellos
Tengo abogados como tiradores
Trabajando pro bono para él como un favor porque les tiro los M
En memoria de Teelo
Ruego que ninguno de los tuyos muera por los teléfonos de la cárcel otra vez
Todo este dolor desde el exterior, inspiró todo este crecimiento interior
Así que los nuevos aviones se rompen
Elevación más alta del yo
Ellos follaron y le dieron a los negros la riqueza correcta
Estas no son canciones, son himnos porque yo soy él
Es el Salmo 151, este Nuevo Testamento
El libro de Hov (El libro de Hov)
Jesús convirtió el agua en vino, para Hov, solo se necesitó una estufa
Nunca se sabe cómo podría ir esta mierda
Biggs y yo probablemente nos hicimos demasiado grandes si no reservan esa carga (¿Qué pasa, Hoffa?)
La retrospectiva es 20/20
Aunque esté recibiendo mucho dinero, mirando hacia atrás ahora, esta mierda es divertida
Acabo de recibir un millón de una sincronización
Sin arriesgar un millón de años tratando de sacarlo del fregadero (Woo)
Hov grande
Dijeron que no me conocen internacionalmente, los negros en el camino lo hicieron
Veo mucho Hov en Giggs
Meek y yo nunca pudimos pelear, liberé a ese negro de una oferta completa
Hov lo hizo
La próxima vez que tengamos una discusión sobre quién es el G.O.A.T., tus burros lo saben
Perdóname, esa es mi pasión hablando (Jaja)

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Bruno Major,sad,"You can't ask a tree to blossom if it isn't spring
Don't leave the house at midnight and expect the birds to sing
If you're looking for a reason, you needn't even try
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die


You can't conjure up more money if you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days if you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water, but you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die

You can't light a fire from nothing, or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart if it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 4]
You can't drum up the heartbeats of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever 'cause nothing ever lasts
If it's keeping you from sleeping, wipe the tear from your eye

This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
[Verse 1]
We in the car, she don't live that far, say she left her purse
And I ain't trippin', you know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust a U, pulled up to her spot, she live by the park
It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, ""What? What he tryna do?"" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee

[Verse 2]
She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""

I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?


​Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted, to leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life

Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me

I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you

Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga

But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart

You think I don't wanna run to you

And there are doors that we can't walk through

But when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see
That it was hopeless after all

Everything keeps us apart

How can we rewrite the stars?

All I want is to fall with you

They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')

It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

Ain't nothing you can say to me that

And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)

Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us

For so long I don't remember Saturday night
Broken records don't play new tunes
'cept for once in a blue moon
And I've looked but the moon is still white

And I've pinned some hope to the summit of someday
Someone somewhere may do something with his life
A smoker's lungs don't blow balloons
'cept for once in a blue moon
And I've looked but the moon is still white
Rusty guns fire rusty shots
Leopards never change their spots
And fireworks always fade too soon
Empty words don't mean a lot
And for me that's all you've got
But I swear to you darling
One day we'll stand beneath a blue moon

I've been living in this month of Sundays
And I forget what Monday morning feels like
Blushing brides and handsome grooms
Deep in debt from honeymoons
Stare above, but the moon is still white

I've wandered into wondering if one day
When the war is won and one finally made two
When we think not of what we're not
And think only of what we've got
And we'll go dancing underneath the blue moon

Oh black kettles and black pots seem to fight an awful lot
And make the kitchen the most uncomfortable of rooms
Empty words don't mean a lot
And for me that's all you've got
And I swear to you darling

Made you cold inside

Jess Glynne,good-vibes,"I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along
[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Verse 2]
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud keep raining over me?
But hearts break and hell's a place that everyone knows

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me


I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""

Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own


I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do

On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere


I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home


Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere


But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that, we can have that


To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

James Morrison,sad,"It’s a sad song that has no end
It’s a bleeding heart that never mends
A minor miracle we can still pretend
After so long
Did the apple fall too far from the tree?
Did we get lost in the space in-between?
But the roots that we buried so deep
Will always be strong


Too late for lullabies
Too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let’s start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I’ll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall

Love burns when it’s in the blood
And god knows I burnt you the best I could
How can three words be so misunderstood?
We got it so wrong
Yeah the greatest gift that you ever gave to me
You don’t know your strength ’till you’ve faced defeat
So when everything’s just out of reach
Keep holding on


Too late for lullabies
Too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let’s start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I’ll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall


We built a brick wall but it’s all for nothing
Only bridges will cross this divide
We both know this road leads to nowhere
There is nothing left for you to hide


Too late for lullabies
Too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let’s start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time

Young nigga straight out the trenches, could tell I been through it all (Yeah)
I knew my life changed, I seen Chico lay on that floor (Yeah)
The night my brother died, through out messages, took a tour
When I scrolled up, I seen Chic' say ""We gon' ball"" (Forever)
That's how I came up with it, bitches know what's up with it (Yeah)
Niggas never fucked with us, niggas, we don't fuck with 'em
Voice of the trenches, I swear the people gon' feel me (Yeah, I know)
I swear to God it's only right I show the real me (Let's get it)
Fuck bein' humble, time to talk my shit (Yeah)
You know BM 850? I'ma cop that whip
Two man, passenger with me, he 'bout to smoke his zip
And we don't argue over bitches 'cause they all got clips, you feel me?
A buck fifty, you niggas is politickin'
Only time that I'm worried is when a dollar go missin'
I'm the man now, bet you niggas don't understand now
I'm from the 'jects, I know how to break a gram down
Arab in the kitchen, I watched how to cook a brick up
You gotta know yourself and I wasn't ready to sit up
Young nigga, big heart, big world, big sharks
If you lose yourself while you in the trenches, you get dogged
It's the summer, catch a nigga, indictment with eight chains
All them niggas say they tough, but they never put in no pain
Always kept it buck fifty, know the streets fuckin' with me
Real recognize real and none of you fuckin' with me
If niggas want it, they can get it, I'ma put that shit in order
My uncle hatin' on me, I'm really feelin' like Porter
Older niggas talkin' crazy, I'm really fuckin' they daughters
How you feelin', lil' nigga? I'm really feelin' like Porter
Any time, get the dice, I don't chill with rats or mice
Any nigga wanna battle, that nigga better be nice
They all love me, I'm the man, bitches look better on the 'Gram
How you likin' on my shit and then say that you got a man?
You know summertime in Harlem I'm comin' to make your block hot
Crusin' 'round these streets, I'm comin' through in a drop-top
Comin' through the east, I be froze but make the spot hot
I told my little mans he better not kiss on no thot-thot

Yeah, I kept it a buck fifty, nigga
Yeah, I know the streets fuckin' with me, nigga

For that moment when the lights go out

It's lighters in the air and you guys up there
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do
Here's to you


There's a silver-tongued blonde trying to sweet talk her way back stage
There's a mom and a dad in the aisle not acting their age
There a wet Corvette red lipstick print on a Coors Light cup
And judging by the way she's dancing I'd say she's had enough

Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died

Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?

Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me

Something in my soul that they can not possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

And others do it for the retail
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on

Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home

"Eminem, Rihanna",sad,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away


All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said


All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go


Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all

Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons, you dig?

What's the point of anything?


All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, ""It's fine, you're just in love""

Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade


Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind

It feels so different being here
I was so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to turn to
I don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over - it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere (nowhere)

I only want you and us

But nothing fills nothing like we used to be
Remember, remember when we said forever
We locked it and we lost the key

Passenger,sad,"When you were younger
Blue eyed boy wonder
Never used to ponder
On what life may hide
Now that you're older
The nights are so much colder
Never even told her
How you feel inside


You were so proud
With your head up in the white clouds
She'd call you so loud
But you'd never know
Now that you're wiser
You'd never compromise her
Everyday you'd realize her
But this bird has flown

And you've blown out all your candles
One by one
And you curse yourself for things you've never done


She would wait for you
Idolize, adore you
Love and reassure you
You couldn't let it be
You let it linger
Slip on through your fingers
So that September
She moved across the sea


How your face dropped
And how your heart stopped
Sitting at the bus stop
When they told you that she'd gone
So you run to the harbor
Need to tell her that you love her
As the boat dissapears
You've never felt so alone


And you've blown out all your candles
One by one
And you curse yourself
For things you've never done

Don't be scared of failure
For the only failure
Is never to try
Never to try
Never to try

We sat apart and watched all we had burned on the pyre
You said, ""We were born with nothing and we sure as hell have nothing now""
You said, ""We were born with nothing and we sure as hell have nothing now""

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

Sam Smith,sad,"Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong


Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy


You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

This is a story I hate
And tellin' it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out


I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?


You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell


I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life

If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally

'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono

That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does

Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold

Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco

I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I

And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture? My picture's in his wallet (WOO!)
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam, now he wanna come home
But I, don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer want him, lookin at his cousin
Kinda buzzin, loose off the Goose
Got him on the chase like cranberry juice
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me (Me)
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be, baby

So I get my head ready cause I know where I'm at

You gotta pay just to get good drinkin water

And the only way to be victorious is to understand your enemy

And we have to realize that their time is up
And if they're desperate...

And he will take you to hell with him

One heart broke, four hands bloody


The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again


All the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

[Chorus]
It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed, but won’t you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

[Bridge]
Up, up, and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

[Verse 3]
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

[Chorus]
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Diggin' for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Lookin' for special things inside of me

Inside of me

Yeah, inside of me
Inside of me
I’m only a man in a funny red sheet

Roberta Flack,sad,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on


Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

The Living Tombstone,good-vibes,"[Verse 1]
They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me ""no""
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain

[Chorus]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time

[Verse 2]
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I’m so humble, I say I'm turning red
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a God, I'm lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love

Ed Sheeran,sad,"Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone


Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself


And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?

Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
Now tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her

It killed you like diseases

The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled

In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?

Fearless Soul,good-vibes,"
LUCRETIA:
Weep not, my gentle boy; he struck but me
Who have borne deeper wrongs. In truth, if he
Had killed me, he had done a kinder deed.
O God Almighty, do Thou look upon us,
We have no other friend but only Thee!
Yet weep not; though I love you as my own,
I am not your true mother.
BERNARDO:
Oh, more, more,
Than ever mother was to any child,
That have you been to me! Had he not been
My father, do you think that I should weep!

LUCRETIA:
Alas! Poor boy, what else couldst thou have done?

[ENTER BEATRICE.]

BEATRICE [IN A HURRIED VOICE]:
Did he pass this way? Have you seen him, brother?
Ah, no! that is his step upon the stairs;
'Tis nearer now; his hand is on the door;
Mother, if I to thee have ever been
A duteous child, now save me! Thou, great God,
Whose image upon earth a father is,
Dost thou indeed abandon me? He comes;
The door is opening now; I see his face;
He frowns on others, but he smiles on me,
Even as he did after the feast last night.

[ENTER A SERVANT.]

Almighty God, how merciful Thou art!
'Tis but Orsino's servant.—Well, what news?
SERVANT:
My master bids me say, the Holy Father
Has sent back your petition thus unopened.

[GIVING A PAPER.]

And he demands at what hour 'twere secure
To visit you again?

LUCRETIA:
At the Ave Mary.

[EXIT SERVANT.]

So, daughter, our last hope has failed. Ah me!
How pale you look; you tremble, and you stand
Wrapped in some fixed and fearful meditation,
As if one thought were over strong for you:
Your eyes have a chill glare; O, dearest child!
Are you gone mad? If not, pray speak to me.

BEATRICE:
You see I am not mad: I speak to you.

LUCRETIA:
You talked of something that your father did
After that dreadful feast? Could it be worse
Than when he smiled, and cried, 'My sons are dead!'
And every one looked in his neighbour's face
To see if others were as white as he?
At the first word he spoke I felt the blood
Rush to my heart, and fell into a trance;
And when it passed I sat all weak and wild;
Whilst you alone stood up, and with strong words
Checked his unnatural pride; and I could see
The devil was rebuked that lives in him.
Until this hour thus you have ever stood
Between us and your father's moody wrath
Like a protecting presence; your firm mind
Has been our only refuge and defence:
What can have thus subdued it? What can now
Have given you that cold melancholy look,
Succeeding to your unaccustomed fear?
BEATRICE:
What is it that you say? I was just thinking
'Twere better not to struggle any more.
Men, like my father, have been dark and bloody,
Yet never—Oh! Before worse comes of it
'Twere wise to die: it ends in that at last.

LUCRETIA:
Oh, talk not so, dear child! Tell me at once
What did your father do or say to you?
He stayed not after that accursed feast
One moment in your chamber.—Speak to me.

BERNARDO:
Oh, sister, sister, prithee, speak to us!

BEATRICE [SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY, WITH A FORCED CALMNESS]:
It was one word, Mother, one little word;
One look, one smile.

[WILDLY.]

Oh! He has trampled me
Under his feet, and made the blood stream down
My pallid cheeks. And he has given us all
Ditch-water, and the fever-stricken flesh
Of buffaloes, and bade us eat or starve,
And we have eaten.—He has made me look
On my beloved Bernardo, when the rust
Of heavy chains has gangrened his sweet limbs,
And I have never yet despaired—but now!
What could I say?

[RECOVERING HERSELF.]

Ah, no! 'tis nothing new.
The sufferings we all share have made me wild:
He only struck and cursed me as he passed;
He said, he looked, he did;—nothing at all
Beyond his wont, yet it disordered me.
Alas! I am forgetful of my duty,
I should preserve my senses for your sake.

LUCRETIA:
Nay, Beatrice; have courage, my sweet girl.
If any one despairs it should be I
Who loved him once, and now must live with him
Till God in pity call for him or me.
For you may, like your sister, find some husband,
And smile, years hence, with children round your knees;
Whilst I, then dead, and all this hideous coil
Shall be remembered only as a dream.

BEATRICE:
Talk not to me, dear lady, of a husband.
Did you not nurse me when my mother died?
Did you not shield me and that dearest boy?
And had we any other friend but you
In infancy, with gentle words and looks,
To win our father not to murder us?
And shall I now desert you? May the ghost
Of my dead Mother plead against my soul
If I abandon her who filled the place
She left, with more, even, than a mother's love!

BERNARDO:
And I am of my sister's mind. Indeed
I would not leave you in this wretchedness,
Even though the Pope should make me free to live
In some blithe place, like others of my age,
With sports, and delicate food, and the fresh air.
Oh, never think that I will leave you, Mother!

LUCRETIA:
My dear, dear children!

[ENTER CENCI, SUDDENLY.]

CENCI:
What! Beatrice here!
Come hither!

[SHE SHRINKS BACK, AND COVERS HER FACE.]

Nay, hide not your face, 'tis fair;
Look up! Why, yesternight you dared to look
With disobedient insolence upon me,
Bending a stern and an inquiring brow
On what I meant; whilst I then sought to hide
That which I came to tell you—but in vain.

BEATRICE [WILDLY STAGGERING TOWARDS THE DOOR]:
Oh, that the earth would gape! Hide me, O God!

CENCI:
Then it was I whose inarticulate words
Fell from my lips, and who with tottering steps
Fled from your presence, as you now from mine.
Stay, I command you—from this day and hour
Never again, I think, with fearless eye,
And brow superior, and unaltered cheek,
And that lip made for tenderness or scorn,
Shalt thou strike dumb the meanest of mankind;
Me least of all. Now get thee to thy chamber!
Thou too, loathed image of thy cursed mother,

[TO BERNARDO.]

Thy milky, meek face makes me sick with hate!

[EXEUNT BEATRICE AND BERNARDO.]
[ASIDE.]

So much has passed between us as must make
Me bold, her fearful.—'Tis an awful thing
To touch such mischief as I now conceive:
So men sit shivering on the dewy bank,
And try the chill stream with their feet; once in…
How the delighted spirit pants for joy!

LUCRETIA [ADVANCING TIMIDLY TOWARDS HIM]:
O husband! Pray forgive poor Beatrice.
She meant not any ill.

CENCI:
Nor you perhaps?
Nor that young imp, whom you have taught by rote
Parricide with his alphabet? Nor Giacomo?
Nor those two most unnatural sons, who stirred
Enmity up against me with the Pope?
Whom in one night merciful God cut off:
Innocent lambs! They thought not any ill.
You were not here conspiring? You said nothing
Of how I might be dungeoned as a madman;
Or be condemned to death for some offence,
And you would be the witnesses?—This failing,
How just it were to hire assassins, or
Put sudden poison in my evening drink?
Or smother me when overcome by wine?
Seeing we had no other judge but God,
And He had sentenced me, and there were none
But you to be the executioners
Of His decree enregistered in heaven?
Oh, no! You said not this?

LUCRETIA:
So help me God,
I never thought the things you charge me with!

CENCI:
If you dare to speak that wicked lie again
I'll kill you. What! It was not by your counsel
That Beatrice disturbed the feast last night?
You did not hope to stir some enemies
Against me, and escape, and laugh to scorn
What every nerve of you now trembles at?
You judged that men were bolder than they are;
Few dare to stand between their grave and me.

LUCRETIA:
Look not so dreadfully! By my salvation
I knew not aught that Beatrice designed;
Nor do I think she designed any thing
Until she heard you talk of her dead brothers.

CENCI:
Blaspheming liar! You are damned for this!
But I will take you where you may persuade
The stones you tread on to deliver you:
For men shall there be none but those who dare
All things—not question that which I command.
On Wednesday next I shall set out: you know
That savage rock, the Castle of Petrella:
'Tis safely walled, and moated round about:
Its dungeons underground, and its thick towers
Never told tales; though they have heard and seen
What might make dumb things speak.—Why do you linger?
Make speediest preparation for the journey!

[EXIT LUCRETIA.]

The all-beholding sun yet shines; I hear
A busy stir of men about the streets;
I see the bright sky through the window panes:
It is a garish, broad, and peering day;
Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears,
And every little corner, nook, and hole
Is penetrated with the insolent light.
Come darkness! Yet, what is the day to me?
And wherefore should I wish for night, who do
A deed which shall confound both night and day?
'Tis she shall grope through a bewildering mist
Of horror: if there be a sun in heaven
She shall not dare to look upon its beams;
Nor feel its warmth. Let her then wish for night;
The act I think shall soon extinguish all
For me: I bear a darker deadlier gloom
Than the earth's shade, or interlunar air,
Or constellations quenched in murkiest cloud,
In which I walk secure and unbeheld
Towards my purpose.—Would that it were done!

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?

Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again

Burn in my bloodstream

Well, tell me when it kicks in


I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now

With the bread, we can make toast

Fuck nigga still doin' the same-o
Niggas hatin' feel like I'm Maino
And I'm in a SRT truck, Trackie, not Durango
Ice on my wrist no bangle, all these chains I'm Django
Think I sipped too much lean last night, woke up with a hangover
You don't speak my lingo, I got a gift and it's a halo

Told the bitch ""I am a porno"", 2 v 1 like a COD match

I got niggas still up in the joint though

Olivia Rodrigo,sad,"We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?


Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies


I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?


And no one can ever hurt me like I've hurt myself
'Cause I'm made out of stone and I'm beyond help
Don't give your heart to me


But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic 'til the day that I die

Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you


That every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true


Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)

Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break

I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down

From somewhere beyond the clouds

A thousand colours in a brighter shadе

There's silver lining that surrounds the grey

I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own


We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Oh, oh-oh


I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?


I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down

Passenger,sad,"One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English park
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart


One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me
Now I smoke like a chimney
It's getting dark in this heart of mine
It's getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away


One went out in the back streets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, have no doubt
When I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

[Verse 4]
One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though we will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore


We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away
We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in our hearts
And they die along the way
Till we're old and we're cold
And we're lying in the dark
Cause they'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day
Oh oh, they'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day

Shoulda gave you all my hours

But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow

Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!

My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it

Rihanna,sad,"Story of my life, searching for the right

Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true


And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go

Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do


If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
Well I would have known
What I was living for all along
What I've been living for

Your love is my turning page
Where only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase


I surrender who I've been for who you are
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
Well I would have known
What I've been living for all along

Looking out the window the hell if I know where I will go

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed",2

If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They vandalizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept

Rascal Flatts,sad,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me


What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken


What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

"Sara Bareilles, John Legend",sad,"When holding your breath is safer than breathing
When letting go is braver than keeping
When innocent words turn to lies

When the pain is all that they offer
Like the kiss from the lips of a monster
You know the famine so well, but never met the feast
When home is the belly of a beast
The ocean is wild and over your head
And the boat beneath you is sinking
Don't need room for your bags, hope is all that you have
So say the Lord's Prayer twice, hold your babies tight
Surely someone will reach out a hand
And show you a safe place to land
Oh, imagine yourself in a building
Up in flames, being told to stand still
The window's wide open, this is leap is on faith
You don't know who will catch you, but maybe somebody will
The ocean is wild and over your head
And the boat beneath you is sinking
Don't need room for your bags, hope is all that you have
So say the Lord's Prayer twice, hold your babies tight

Trapped in the adventurers' cave
All condemned to languish in darkness
Silence and madness
Forever paying the price
In the heart of the mountain

In a dream you saw the land of gold
As the mountain tempted in a vision
Where the angels spread their wings
There's where you'll find your freedom

To the glorious dream your soul was sold
To find the house of God became your mission
So you left your past behind
And now you're heading for the sky

Broken angel wings, I been rushing to the grave
Nobody ever show you love until you make a name

I need you by my side
To tell me that I'ma be fine
I'm such a mess, staying up every night
Nobody knows what I lock deep inside
I know I can do this I just need some time
It's evident, they say I'm heaven sent
Work on my art I can't focus on negatives
I'm over all of this isn't it obvious?
I don’t want your love if it's just empty promises
Live a life that's full of sin and self destruction
So high I can barely even function
Going up I'm blasting off just like a missile
I might die before I reach my full potential
Feeling down and so I go and light the sticky up
Running laps inside my head it's like it never stop
Never had it now I do and now they want a taste (Thank you, sadface)

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first result
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you are having a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art""-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?

But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues


'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

Cut to the part she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known, I guess you should've known
That I would talk, I would talk

You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go

I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place


Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to walk away

Passenger,sad,"Lying on a mattress cause my friend's crazy sister took my bed away
Sleeping she looked like an actress in theory and in practice
I said there's got to be a better way
She said you light a thousand matches
When you finally set fire will you run away?
So why'd you go and do it
When you knew that you would go and I would stay?

I hit the wall in frustration, the conversation had been circling for days
She said don't take it out on him, for the wall has always been
Supportive in the best of ways
We're laughing and crying like madmen dying in the snow
For just one second it was funny that she would have to stay and I would go
And I said love, you know, I love you so
When you love someone well you've gotta let 'em know
She said ""Nothing's changed, I love you the same
When you love someone, sometimes you gotta let 'em go""

She handed me a stone in the perfect shape of a heart
She said I'm gonna take this home
For I know you'll only lose it somewhere after dark
In some faceless hotel room
You seem to lose everything you know
She didn't mean it how it sounded
What she meant was she would stay and I would go

And I said love, you know, I love you so
When you love someone well you've gotta let 'em know
She said ""Nothing's changed
I love you the same
When you love someone
Sometimes you gotta let 'em go""

Sometimes you tear it all apart
To see the wood from the trees
Sometimes you break your own heart
To set yourself free

I walked her to the station
Hesitation in our movements and our tone
Words finally left after realizing
How uncomfortable they'd grown
See, what you want and what you need, well
They seldomly succeed to grow
We reluctantly agreed that when you love someone
You gotta let them go",0

On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in
[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Nobody - I'm just resurrecting Keith Sweat for the heck of it
Sometimes I hate my aggression it gets the best of me
Like I was possessed and I need the exorcist
Until they hear me I keep rushin' up the field like Emmitt Smith
Cocky like a boxing champ
Do excuse me 'cause my mind is kinda like a lava lamp
Savage like I'm Macho Man
Go induce a logo on the side of my Versace lens
Thinking like I should be singing in a Mariachi band
Hola, que pasa guey?
You should really watch the way you stepping to me
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled, lame as fuck, and it ain't tough for me to spot a rotten egg
Had to squash you, homie, I'm a giant, I'm colossal
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
I just need a Xannie bar, a couple shots inside my nostril
When I'm Michael coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel
Fuck a rapper, I would rather be compared to Aristotle, where the bottle?
Simply miss, another Caribou, where the Lou?
Pussy fronting with a gun they scared of you, scared of who?
Somebody better go and let them know that what they better do is

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya

Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em

Pop pop pop pop off at the mouth
How I do it so fluid spew it, never soft as a mouse
Sick as sewage, I grew it too, it’s coolest talk at the house
Missou is the truest, you is foolish, flossin' about
Bickin' it back and I’m bein' a better one
Somethin' better was never done
If you wanna win this cheddaring, you really better go get a gun
Yes, I’m packin' the potion that’s never lackin' promotion
Have you stackin' and toastin' 'cause now you rappin' and grossin'
People set in they sin, 'bout the bread I’m makin'
That I made and never gave it, yo, where the heck is they been?
Said the label ain't charitable, gonna be checkin' they chin
The second they grin you really want it step and say when
But I’m in Monaco, on a boat, puffin' that chronicle
Dishonorable when they hate the Snake and Bat logo upon the coat
So if they wanna mope and leave us, you can bet I'ma vote
Gassin' like Conoco and killin' 'em off is comical
You should prolly think about it 'fore you get up and you doubt it 'bout the pen game, definitely insane
I will become the in thing, music will then change
Take your family and friends brain, now they within Strange

Rittz got it to a T that’s why we gettin' the sound spread around now

We show at the party, you feel like it? Let us in yo body
Oddity, how did he make 'em a commodity?
Hardly handle the bussin' it's a part of me
I feel like we're picking on other rappers and labels
They ain't sitting at the table with us, able as us
Maybe they division is 'cause they lacking in paper and we pay bills
What happened to some cray deals
Snake and the Bat, we lackin' on nothin', we'd be gauge strapped
Sayin' that rap it ain't 'bout nothin', they be frontin' frontin'
Takin' 'em back to putting paper in people's hands
So fecal on evil people, I'm making all the people dance
I know there'll be a lot of handgrabbin' and man baggin'
Even if they pants saggin' they be damn faggots
I'ma stay in creased khakis with a tan jacket
They can stand back 'cause Sam going ham sandwich
Bringing the same same mainstream game to the Strange team game 'cause the people really borin' ya

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)

I swear, that I'll never be a saint, no way
A chair in the corner is my place I stay
I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
But keep on praying

Walking in the wrong shoes

Passenger,sad,"Sometimes, when the light catches her face
In a very particular way
It remind's me so true
Of a girl that I once knew

And there's something in her voice
That has left me with no choice
And a memory's renewed
Of a girl that I once knew

And there's something when she smiles
Drawing lines around her eyes
There's a key hole I see through
To a girl that I once knew
Sometimes, it's almost too much
When I feel her gentle touch
Running fingers down and through
Like a girl that I once knew

And to hear her sleeping breath
The rise and falling of her chest
Moonlight paints her ghostly blue
Like a girl that I once knew

And the girl that I once knew
Left me empty and confused
Yet it feels different somehow
With the girl that I know now

Am I just livin' in the space between
The beauty and the pain
And the real thing

Now the sky is painted
In a wash of indigo
I've been holdin' on too long
That I hardly know the score


I recognize every face
But I ain't got everything I need
If I'm just livin' in the space between
The beauty and the pain
It's the strangest thing

Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal

Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough

Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me


We're not the only ones

It is the world to me
That you are in my life

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you


Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right


Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own


And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again

You said, ""Light my cigarette""

I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

James Arthur,sad,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night


When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go

Adele,sad,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?


It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

So why bring Quantum to Physics?
You a good investment
Business wise you make awful decisions
And you got some investments that you regretted, right?
Which ended with the loses of riches
But you came back from the dead (debt), after T-Rex, nigga you evolved from the chicken
Bar God!
The nigga that good at pretendin' to be brave but when you scared as hell you the worst
Like I spend time horsing around and I would carousel through the verse
I'm here to expose this man to the core, expose that there's a trail to [?]
That's the [?] scratches the surface
Your era (error) failed human's first
So both loses I plan it (planet) within the pair of L (parallel) universe

Nigga my tendency to snap will kill these (Achilles) legends
He'll (heel) know (nose) these nerves in my bone
Nigga on the set guns come out, cap you, slap you
Okay (OK) Shine him, an old word we learned from Charron
Bar God!
Reincarnated, oh I save your birth through a clone
Snakes and trees in makes it Eve-n at 'em (Adam) shit like the serpent was on
So when they say he workin' in churches and that he fuckin'...worship from home
Hand on a Bible, I will put him down in the ground, in a hole he worse, something wrong
Bar God!
We gotta work on your tone
Cause you wanna know what a maestro is Danny?
A maestro is determined by who can fuckin' orchestrate it the best
I'll tell you a classic tale Danny, a classics tale, though the story dated, it's fresh
You'll get the rope meant for your next (neck) scene, it's more for savin' ya breath
You'll make the news (noose) soon as I push up on you, this story made for the press
You know what a noose is right? It's an O (ooh) shape for ya neck
Makin' sure there's no outlet to out let breath for the space in ya chest
I get the power trippin', grab the extension cord, then aided his death
Cause I fuckin' hated the way that he dressed
No trace remains, remnants left
But still leave a nasty outline
You've been yelling your whole career Danny, you finally raspy? Bout time
I scream AHHHH!
You know it's me nigga baskin' outside
Danielle (then yell) ""Bregoli"", nigga catch me outside!
And your family? Cloud 9
Beautiful people, helluva mixture
Yeah your son, takes after you
As he grows his head'll gets bigger
Him and his sis' look alike, that's what was said in the picture
So when he gets shot next to her
BAOW, he gon' really look dead on his sister
That's a helluva mixture
Nigga to stop this coughin', nigga no Robitussin
So disgustin', grass greener over here
It's clear, let me hear that [?] to somethin'
Yeah I would (wood) chuck ya body up into a plot until this hole we dug in
Oh we sunken
Like a beaver, dam(n), water flow, so constructed
Know my cousin'll
Put you underground for free, trust me, they would (wood) let it go for nothin'

The only way you could lay a nigga out is if you break the mold in somethin'
And not seasoned just smidgen, you can't-nigga grow for nothin'
Get it, can't season, just a smidgen he can't grow for nothin'
Listen, life is complex 'til ya quit and wait for a great holster button
Roastin' subjects, you got sons and daughters, right?
Good, they both should love this
At this pace, recooking you is Easy Bake toaster Oven
Speed it up, no, at this pastry cookin', you easy bake toaster oven

You hear the ring?
Shit get deadly after the phone call
U-Haul, Ryder, Penske, you hope to be here after the long haul
This only work if I let it ring; on-call
Nigga it don't get no higher than this, how you done ran into the stonewall
Apple Music listed with the TEC song in ya title
I prove America's Got Talent cause what the best show?
An Idol
I will throw you a pass, like what's the catch? Nigga I guess throwin' spirals

Make him feel it, makes the movie more real
Seeing as I don't have to fuckin' fake the villain

I probably should have paper billing
Pay per Dillon, long as everybody counting and they drive laid out I can show you how to make a kill-

[Round 1: Danny Myers]
Aye last round he said
Soon as he said ""microwave"", an idea popped in my head like ""Ding!""
Y'all good at takin' quizzes?
Why all I had to do was buy his bitch an oven? That's how easy bae can (baking) get it!
Bar God versus God Pen
I'm here to spite my rival
Cause God never used the pen if he had man write the Bible
Despite the title, I use the chrome to define it
First I pistol whip him 'til I knock every bone from alignment
Remember when Nas put out that artist?
That set the tone for the violence
Cause the first thing Quan asked for was 'A Moment' of silence
Ain't you a pimp? I feel sorry for your daughter when niggas meet her
Cause using her body for every matter is what Physics teach her (teacher)
It's way serious, I put in work, this .40 ours (hours)
This your cut off day, and you gon' pay, period
I'm checkin' you, don't try to jump me, you'll get your buddies tore
If it's 3 D (3D) fighting, I turn into an animal, this is Bloody Roar
This nothin' I had to study for
I already know about my nemesis
Cane ('caine) and Abel (enabled) him to be dope before he had a Genesis
You usin' an old system, them played out schemes, you gon' be sorry nigga
Now the fuck you birthed the sons (S.O.N.S.) and still end up on Maury nigga?
Let's explore these rivers, I'm talkin' 'bout the flow, bitch my pen is pure
My Glock? .40, but it's one in the head, this bitch immature
You Qleen, Prez and Bangz have to be doubted
The irony, you four of ya (euphoria) kill and be happy about it
I'm wit' all the scandalous shit
Fo' fo' Magnum ready to damage shit
This will knock you two feet, let's see you freestyle about this Cannon kicks
Outlandish shit
Serious tactics, shoot the nigga
His mom gon' cry on queue (Q) like an experienced actress
My nigga worked two jobs to buy a whip
He came from the hard knocks it was usual
Every time he pulled up, we gave him all props, it was beautiful
Do you believe in a parallel universe?
(I do)
Soon as his car stopped it was two of 'em
They did him dirty in his car then we had a car wash for his funeral
All the concepts, I wrote for this culture, you wouldn't dare such
So you, who they figure for (four), the best pen (pin), got me flared (flaired) up
Now tap wit' me, let's push the boundaries of a rhyme battle
Theoretically it would take Quantum Physics to make it possible to time travel
Let's flash forward
I'll run up on this nigga and let the Tom' speak
He falls, bleeding, next to two lovers names written in concrete
It'll make sense later, meanwhile, he writin' with all these crews
I'm in his grill, wondering if bar be Q's (barbecues)
You cook too slow, you shouldn't be rapping with Myers
Y'all ain't seen Quantum Physics with this type of energy since the Hadron Collider
I'm the last of the writers, I came from the class of the fighters that prove themselves by lastin' in ciphers
I hold the toast tight...I know where you be at on most nights
If cops don't know who came up with those rounds, it means you a ghost, right (write)?
No slight, despite all that sugar in his face
Quinten's pen still got him hooked up with a Drake
Y'all done booked another snake
Deposit thief, he'll part with your funds
QP a Heartless Con', but that's how he started the S.O.N.S
I'm too smart for these bums
You on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got another two rounds of this shit
Yikes!
You might also like[Round 2: QP]
He said something about two lover's name in the concrete
That was interesting
Til I pull this stick out wit' ya name on it, nigga that cemented it
Bar God!
Y'all nigga think this nigga said, ""Let there be light"" and in sync that's when mind joy came
That's what y'all think?
Nigga, he got- here's a Chilla
We got niggas up in Canada slavin' hard for a white boy chain
ICE!
I thought the Glock make him *gun cock* Caucasian, turn him into Bryce, Roy, Blaine
Everything I'm airing (Aaron), landin' (Landon) soundin' like white boy names
I feel like I know pain, like a bitch doctor
No, get it? Gyno-pain
But I seen growth inside this pussy, I figured I'd help by assist
Get it? Growth inside this pussy, I can help by a cyst
Push that Bar God shit on me nigga, like Hell I resist
Nigga then what happened?
Respect is shown when you set the tone nigga you can tell by the pitch
Cause Q talk like a man and Dan yell (Danielle) like a bitch
A family of 12? That's legit!
Nigga that's tradition
What y'all do? Pray but don't eat? What you teach 'em fast? Religion
Get it? Pray, don't eat, fast, religion
Free bread and cheese, eggs and beans, nigga that was wicked
Nigga no money for your freezer, that just means your cash was frigid
Get your thumb and middle finger to meet up
You see the clash to friction
When you make an abrupt choice to get food stamps, it was a snap decision
I say birth control Danny, controls your life
It's too late to pull out that now
His son Joey, uncool
Jesse, Kimmy, nothin' cool about that pal
Michelle, Stephanie, DJ *scratches* on the set you swap that child
I'm just here to check Danny's character and pay you in Full
How's (House) that sound?
Bar God!
Listen to the transition, a full out black cloud
Thinkin' like a cave man, my first thought was fire
Figured I'd give you my first invention
Give you a round, dressed to kill, so what I bought? A tire
Round, dressed to kill, which means you bought attire
Now that me and this weenie linked up, my first thought is to fry ya
Dutch could've brought worse (bratwurst)
But you don't need to sausage guy to
See he ain't in the Ballpark and done nathan to be the nations top supplier
I said, actin' like you want beef dawg, you deserve an Oscar....
Nigga cops behind ya, you didn't flip a bitch fast enough
See how quick shit can catch up (ketchup) to you
Then what happens?
Washington University, alma mater
What that mean?
I'm leavin' with that W
Tom Brady, I Drew he bled slow (Bledsoe)
Back up to who?
Nigga the K blast a fade past
You're way up in the air it'll catch up to you
So much mustard on it in hindsight, course it'll catch up (ketchup) to you
Bar God!
Nigga the facts bruh is you, a myth, fake and phony
Sega/Sony
Iconic, in a lane by myself
This type of fame is lonely
Possession, that's a helluva thing, you wanna know what Satan told me?
My performance ain't grippin' still, he ain't moved at all
But fuck it, praise the glory
Cause idle hands do the devil work, so tell the church to keep prayin' for me
But they not movin' cause they idle, then-then what happens?
Ya skin is faded glory
Yeah cause you a light skinned nigga that like to black on the set I guess that he thinkin' that he Vivian
Yeah, yeah, that ring a bell?
Air shots, ain't no secrets to Willie Smith
Think [?] space, garbage disposal
I'll sneak into ya kitchen and flip the switch
Leave this fool drained in more pain til the point you can swim in it
Remember when, I force it down with the pipe, right?
He gon' sink until oblivion
Nigga time
[Round 2: Danny Myers]
Yo' mama fucked every nigga in this buildin' and that brings that boy shame
She got fucked by Derek, Kewon and Joseph, those are black boy names
Then he talkin' 'bout food stamps and shit
He had a couple dope lines but plenty was corny
Since you talkin' 'bout food stamps, tell yo' mama I got 20 for 40
I'm not one of these league owners, you owe me bread, you better rush things
Unless you wanna be fed your homies intestines, let's discuss things (disgusting)
I'll grab your scrawny neck, tie a rope around him and strangle it
This isn't quite what they mean by ""quantum entanglement""
Then I use my fist, to bash in ya skull and mangle it
Then stab you at 90 degrees, not only do I punch I angle shit
You're a living blaxploitation, I'll murder this cat
So this fake pimp shouldn't mind a 'Return Of The MAC(k)'
I hate to bring up, how you be fuckin' with them lines
I mean, I ain't even wanna put substance in my rhymes
His whole judgement is a crime, all he do is sniff checks
This nigga went and got clean (Qleen) and still can't pass a piss test
Why would you risk death? Use the rest of your senses
You took the term ""dope MC"" and went professional wit' it
I can set the gun on a tripod, but I ain't gonna get technical wit' it
We just shoot at his rim without the legs like the Special Olympics
I grab the snub, loosen my belt, stuck the mag' into it
Once I spot him, I line up the nose, you a bad influence
Ruthless, I'll come to his hood, he don't see the chopper
Once I enter Quantum realm that's when he'll need a Doctor
Strange, how he sees my goons everywhere he go
And I can foresee 14,000,605 different scenarios
Who will Avenge you?
I'll run this nigga over in a fast Coupe
He won't be able to get the horn out his head like a jazz loop
I hope y'all listenin', he nice wit' that pen
But my class older
Jesus, there's so many Easter eggs in these rounds y'all might pass over (Passover)
Before you started slippin', you were really spittin' the truth
Once Q lost his grip that's when he was given the Juice
He claim he been pimpin', but all his money, them hoes been spendin'
You doin' all this punchin', just to give back to a bitch like Ken's endin'
I don't slack a bit, I'm the GOAT in this battle rappin' shit
I said, ""pimpin'"", ""Ken"" that mean when you Street Fight you should slap a bitch
Bar God!
You can't beat nobody in NWX, where the fuck is yo' real skill?
Can y'all see Quinten (Quentin) tearin' T? No (Tarantino), you couldn't even Kill Bill
I am the real deal, I specialize in squeezin', I do push ups with the Devil to exercise my demons
I'm the best alive for reasons
I done did the crime route
I was placed in a box with a lid to climb out
Got a Sig' (cig') for the guy's mouth
QP be like, ""And then what happens?""
Bitch you ain't gon' live to find out!
My pen can divide clouds, your reign (rain) is over, I'll kill a team
I'll behead your whole family
With that knife work my skill is mean
But if they underage, I'll cut a slice in they cheek
That means I won't cut off they head but I'll gill a teen (guillotine)
My skill is seen, the best writers, I done hurt this nigga
Y'all better hope the third rock from the SON (sun) or I'ma Earth this nigga
What's your purpose nigga?
You on the ground with this shit?
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes!

[Round 3: QP]
I guess pimpin' caught up wit' me, nigga that was karma
You throwin' your hat off and exposin' a bald head *gun clicks* nigga see that's a problem
But you wanna know what my fear (mafia) is?
My fear (mafia); turning into John Gotti, leaving you past injured (passenger)
Voluntarily, like you called shottie
Drop the shot in ya mug then sip tea, nigga Hot Toddy
In the scope a beam, the scope the beam laser
Taggin' each dot obvi'
Tryin' to pinpoint if wreck'll be (freckle) be the reason that he got bodied
Figured I'd meet (meat) with this burger
And this Joe would liquid since he got sloppy
All we can do is pray as he spray each of his shots by me
Whole time I'm thinkin, ""Why blast for missin' (blasphemous) shots when it's not godly?""
Bar God!
Nigga this fairy tale is bizarre odd
Nigga you're five foot nothin', your standards should be lowered; Farquaad!
Know to leave money construction, well ding (welding) if I spark rods
Nigga that's crazy
That's what [?] cry
I mean nightmares, day daymares, night- nigga life is full of dreams
Like when Police kick in your door and shoot you
At that point even the bullets sting
[?] even in jail, low self esteem, that's where the [?]
That's when shit get real boy and I wouldn't (wooden) bring
My ventriloquist, big dawg act to this pup, It means I pulled a string
Stare into the five, leave dread shook; Booker T
With the Drake, oh, (Drako) the kid hidin'
Why? Cause this'll Pusha-T
That's crazy with the Drako, kid hidin', cause this push ya tee
Nigga Twork, Kenny, Grim Reaper in a room still ain't as hood as me
Nigga I'm Jordan in his prime so if I know history you'll just watch the bull repeat
Living life to the fullest means, cherishing your life meter
Make sure you're sustainin' health, stayin' out the way
Not in the picture, nigga remainin' stealth
But if you come to me for assistance, I'll act indifferent, the moment you came for help
Then I show 'em the ropes, but with restrains and belts
Figured since I'm the nice guy, I'll give him the cord you'll (cordial) hang yourself
I feel like I was on the cane ('caine) and fell
But when you got the power to ghost nigga, who you go and grab quick?
The Tommy
Oddly, you'll die by fire, I strike, nigga this match stick's a homi
Nigga the pistol stretch lookin' like bitches that practice Pilates
Arms, legs, [?], heads up, nigga back to the body
I'll insert early, Jersey, nigga that was Tsunami
Rounds got the white meat showing through the packs of salami
I heat this up
Eat this up, nigga I didn't ask for pastrami
That's kinda crazy, nigga like you Brad from college
When I go to Yale, nigga Princeton is out
I'll do you Shady, remove your stain like when Eminem shout
Scientology, Tom Cruise, really a remedy now
No, Tom Cruise, Scientology, really Leah Remini now
Literally now, I can't look past the it factor
You get religiously clown
You said somethin' 'bout Juice last round, right?
Well if you got the juice you take the steel, I give a Bishop a baow (bow)
Then what happens?
A peel (pill) to your point your brain feelin' unLimitless now
Then what happens my nigga
Danny Myers, why wait? His smile's fake, he ain't Snicker-ing now
Cause it's apparent anyone raisin' a 12 ain't kiddin' around
And with Vicki around...or estranged wife
And with Vicki around there's no battle rap groupies for you nigga
Nope, really it's your BM
Yeah, he's like, ""I would have a bad bitch in a parallel universe nigga"" instantly [?]
But as for Vicki I don't like to dog her
You see how quickly he would seat 'em?
Then what happens?
But name one bitch that hit Danny Myers up initially in the DM
That makes this right, Danny Myers initially D.M., Danny Myers
Today's opposite day, Danny Myers is a Plan B buyer
Bar God!
Then I'll come and anti-Christ ya
Then what happens?
Nigga you broke the cardinal rule in the field
When you let the Canadian come in and ran it by ya
Yeah, leavin' the playin' field shouldn't have been safe for real, you should've let that man retired
And you're pushin' 40?
You was supposed to fuckin' murder Pat til men (Tillman) said it was friendly fire
And I was like, ""And you represent the black people, right?""
When he cookin' up there's a Panther in the kitchen
But we actually sell dope so when we cookin' there's a pan there in the kitchen

[Round 3: Danny Myers]
Aye, when AC set this battle up
I thought he'd regret the call
I mean QP 'round here battlin' like he ain't in debt at all
I ain't think he was gonna show up, I was willin' to bet it all
I thought he was gonna steal money out of AC like Luther in Set It Off
I am human Fentanyl
I obliterate rappers
Science has taught me that Quantum Physics manipulates matters
R3 and the QP's, I'll knock both of 'em out
Call Of Duty taught me that if I press R3 the scope will come out
This what the focus about?
Peep what this author been pennin'
Versus Xcel I rewound a scenario and gave it an alternate endin'
But y'all gon' tell me, I'm not a better writer than this nerd clown
Versus B. Dot I used my son to set up a haymaker in the third round
This absurd now, I'll spray these niggas in the face then finish you
I'm a Bad Boy and 'Only You' will know why I'm macing (Ma$e and) Slim and Q
One 12 (112) gauge will get the job done
I'll put slugs through you
Act wild, watch how calm you get when that sub do (subdue) you
I'll hire two lawyers for my nigga case
I promised I'd never fail him
He got caught with that pistol I was hopin' that pair will bail him (Parabellum)
I knew one day, I'd really have to start cookin' with that pencil
So once they gave me Q (queue) I took it as a signal
Just look at the potential
This could be a grand slam
They tired of the weak bars, we know where the fans stand
Deuce deuce, small caliber, comin' from the hand fam'
Tiny shit, get stuck in Quantum region like Ant-Man
I'll show up to your funeral
Pay my respects, greet your fam' in the lobby
That's when Physical'll (physical) realize I came to examine the body
AR got the sight attached, drum barrel
I mean everything sharp on it
Whether (weather) modification makes a difference or not I won't harp (HAARP) on it
Dark moment, you invented the ""Slow It Down"" and took a total loss
The irony, you let Con' do it (conduit) and never got ya flow across
Get broken off
In this third I (eye) set the course, you normally write next to whores now you're right next to Horus
Welcome to the forest
Let's push the boundaries of a rhyme battle
Theoretically it would take Quantum Physics to make it possible to time travel
Let's flash backwards
Before the riots, on the west it was less intense
Your father at age 12, meets your mom and writes their name in the wet cement
Although he's happy cause it's the moment he been wishin'
He watchin' the sun (son/S.O.N.) fall and is overcome with premonition
Bar God!
I watch you versus Fresco...I said, ""You need mo' rhymes.""
The white boy beat Physics like when Brent Barry dunked from the free throw line
I got steel in my warm ups
Wait, wait, Brent Barry dunked while he was still in his warm ups
The skill is enormous
I'm Robin Williams when the torch is wit' me
Cause I start the show poppin' out the big shell like Mork & Mindy
Kill this nigga Quinten was all up in my mentions
Fuck havin' the best pen, my pen deserves a pension
Motherfucker
And you on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit

He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Rascal Flatts,sad,"I was sitting on a bar stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tear stains on his old shirt
Then he said, ""Do you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards?""


You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling, bling, bling, and a diamond ring
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley

It sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

Well, I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said, ""Wait a minute, that's not all, there's even more""


You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn and the bale and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy (A little crazy), a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
Oh, play that song

Passenger,sad,"Well if love is blind
Then home's where the heart is
How we ever gonna get back where we started
From now on, run with blindfolds
Into the woods till the trees knock us out cold
Winds shriek like drunken females
On a hen night, last bit of fun
Till he breaks her heart in a text or an email
She can deal with the bastard son

We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope
I'll make a promise just to break it for the sake of it
We think that we're honest but truth is what we make it to be
Well a stitch in time saves nine, that's fine
But we've all been proper stitched up this time
It's a right old mess at a grand old time
Right and left, in front and behind
It's Sunday, Sunday, another bloody Sunday
Just a day till another bloody Monday
Morning, yawning, boring, snoring
In front of the boss when you just got a warning

We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me
Just so there's someone else to blame when it all falls down
When it all falls down, down, down
When it all falls down, down

So let's get some fire in our hearts
And a yellow brick road
I'm getting bored of the dark
We could turn the lights on, you know
I'll make a promise and I'll keep it for the sake of it
We could tell the truth for once, see just how we take to it
We could walk in forests and climb up every tree
We'll build our house upon the sand, every day in the sea
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me
Just so there's somebody else
Just so there's somebody else

Passenger,sad,"With progress comes problems
With wisdom comes age
With lessons come learning
And pleasure comes with pain

You can only have the sunshine after the rain

I took a walk
It got me thinking
Left foot, right foot
Smiling, blinking
Breathe out, breathe in
Somehow linking
My soul to my mind and my heart to my mouth
Lost and the found and the north to the south
And the corners to the circle in my mind

We may find that the gate has been locked
When we come back down to what we really are
Retrace the footprints off the path that is lost
It's like trying to find a needle in the dark

My hands they are empty
But they are clean
I'm poor but I'm healthy
I'm halfway between
The gutter and the skyline

So I took a walk to the land's end
Thinking ‘bout an ex-girlfriend that I had
And the pages that I've turned
And it seems to me
That we all love the chase
But once we're caught we feel encased
Behind bars of love and trust
Uprooted by drunken lust
By people, people just like us
People, people just like us

I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food

Turn my back on you all and you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree

Looking for something I prolly could never find now
Shit get real up until the beef die down

I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

Passenger,sad,"He's the deflated balloon wrapped around your gait
Cut priced to clear a past to ""sell by date""
He'll be the fool running through the churchyard screaming out ""it's not too late""
And When he does, I know that you'll wait
He's the drunk man with bad breath coming home on too strong
But he's the beauty queen that strings your heart along
And he'll answer every question in your new-age magazine wrong
But I know you love him strong
So I'm leaving for there's nothing to believe in
I'm just grieving for a love I never knew
Please don't go misreading me
I'm not saying you've been misleading me
Just not needing me the way that I need you
Well he's the elephant in the room that never speaks
But you dream about him every two weeks
And I wouldn't know his name, but you call it in your sleep
Oh I know you love him deep

So run back to him like you should
I guess I always knew that you would
For he's captured your heart in a way I never could
So go on and love him good

Oh I'm leaving for there's nothing to believe in
I'm just grieving for a love I never knew
You're the book I can't stop reading
I'm the stray cat you've been feeding
But the tides they are receding now it's true

As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with

Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions

I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward

Just look into your beautiful lies
Now you been damn gone what a shame
But my feelings gonna stay the same

Girl you always talked, I never listened
It got too hot, I got out the kitchen
Got a life to live, so I got to livin'
Now its you and only you that I find missin'
All them hot nights, all them free days
Always kept your body movin' like a DJ
Back it up, back it up, keep it movin' on

We were always on, automatic start
Push a button and your bed was automatic art
You always played the part, I never played to win
Now you're gone again

But I never got past the past beginnin'
Looked for another but I could not find her

But we never bent so 'ventually it had to break

Lukas Graham,sad,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old


It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old


I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me


Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)


I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold

Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry


Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

James Blunt,sad,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

Sara Bareilles,sad,"It's not simple to say
Most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them


It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine


It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life
Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

You're not what I asked for

I would give it all back for

Growing stronger each day

To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room

I can't believe I've cried all these tears
My friends tell me I should've moved on
A long long time ago
But what do they know?
What do they know?


And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

I wonder what happens when you hear our song
Do you brush it away or do you sing along?
Do you talk about the future the way we did?
Is there room for me in it?
Is there room for me in it?


And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world


Is it so wrong of me to hope she breaks your heart?
Is it so wrong of me to pray she tears you apart?
And I know that in the darkest part of you
You pray and hope and wish for it too


'Cause you don't mean to be selfish
But your heart breaks every time
That you see me smile

Celebrated for weeks in a row

It still hurts that I'm alone

"Eminem, Nate Dogg",aggressive,"Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left
[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof

Alessia Cara,good-vibes,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Though you've forgotten half the words

You ain't gonna make it, you ain't never ever gonna break it
You can never beat 'em, man, they're better than you, face it
Thinking that they give a damn, you're not thinking straight kid
Nah, they don't give a damn, you got what I'm sayin'?
I'm not fucking playin', I'll give it to you straight, man
There's too many others and you're not that great, man
Stop what you're sayin', stop what you're makin'
Everybody here knows that you're just fakin'
Nah, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
All these fucking thoughts, they are not what I need anymore
I'm about to shut the motherfucking door
On all you poor ass haters with your heads in the clouds
Talkin' out loud, so proud
You better shut your goddamn mouths
Before I do more than speak out, it's about to head south

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?


They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny


Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake

Avril Lavigne,sad,"I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard


God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most


God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
And keep my head above water, above water
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown


And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe


God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waitin'
I'm too young to fall asleep
So, God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water

"Daniel Caesar, Kali Uchis",aggressive,"Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
La-la-la-la-la
If you've got someone you like
(Don't you love when I come around)
Somebody just tell somebody
If you've got someone you like
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody (build you up then I take)
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise",2
"Rihanna, Calvin Harris",good-vibes,"It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
