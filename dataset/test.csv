Andrew Ripp,good-vibes,"I was there when your life began
Drew the lines in the palm of your hand
Heard you cry, did you think I'd let you go?
I was there when you took a step
Held your mom as she held her breath
Walked with you when you thought you were alone
I was there, did you think I'd let you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
When the steady ground crumbles
I'll be the place where you stand
When you're heartbroken
I will be strong whеn you can't
I'm here when you'rе ready
To trust me again
Let go of your life and
Find you have always been
[Chorus]
In good hands (In good hands)
In good hands (In good hands)
In good hands

[Verse 2]
I was there when the walls collapsed
Stayed with you 'til the storm had passed
Heard your prayer, did you think I'd ever leave?
I was there in the darkest night
Crawled with you into morning light
Gave you strength when your weary soul was weak
I was there, did you think I'd ever leave?
When the steady ground crumbles
I'll be the place where you stand
When you're heartbroken
I will be strong when you can't
I'm here when you're ready
To trust me again
Let go of your life and
Find you have always been

In good hands (In good hands)

Ed Sheeran,sad,"Nah nah nah nah nah


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love

Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus

Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

You say ""On God, no cap""
We say ""Swear on your life, don't gass""
You say ""Spin the block""
We say ""Jump out and slide and crash""
You call it ""machine,"" we call it a ""mash""
Strip club and they're shakin' ass
But in my words, they're shakin' nyash
We don't trap in abandoned buildings
Shots get hit out of vacant flats
In other words, ""apartments,"" hidden compartments get detached
Free all the members that got bagged
You say ""What's up?,"" we say, ""Wagwan""
Got shotguns from a farm
We don't eat pork, we say it's Haram
You call her ""shawty,"" we call her ""jawn""
Sexy gyal and we call them ""leng""

Bare words that we got for guns
Like ""waps"" and ""skengs""
You call them ""Js"", we call them ""cats""

We fill up the Pyrex pot and boil it
In London, I'm verified
In N.Y, I'm valid
Twelve hours away, I'm M.I.A, I can pull up on DJ Khaled
It's only an hour away from the ends, that's why I spend time in Paris
If I pull up on Saturday Night, I ain't come here to talk, this ain't Jimmy Fallon (Ah, yeah)
I just pulled up with a chick bro said that he hit, I'm a bit embarrassed, huh
All she's gettin' is dick and Chick-Fil-A, we ain't eatin' salmon
I might hit one time and vanish, I got unlimited funds on the Amex

Shippin' them bowls, police keep takin' his phone
He in prison and he put me on
I'm still rappin', got rich, now I'm tryna get him home
Yeah, somebody tell Meek and Jay-Z help me go get my cousin
Ain't got time to play with this shit
Don't play with me, play with yo' kids
Niggas know Baby bussin', they know I got stain in this bitch
Aim at a bitch, shoot out the side of the Maybach
And went back and painted the whip
Pay me a lawyer, bulletproof trucks for my daughter
So coppers can't spray at the whip
'Cause I got a AR, he got a Glock, huh
""Damn, that nigga still shootin'""
That lil' shit done ran outta shots, huh?
Catch a nigga go and eat shit, bet before a nigga speak
He gon' think before he talk now
I was the hottest rapper in the world
Gettin' in shootouts right in front of a cop car
Spray, nigga
I got a red flag, made out of gym shorts (Yeah)
I got that mojo, sprayed on top of New Years card
I just got my court date pushed back, they tryna make it hard
Tryna see if I'm lucky for to find that new pack on the yard
My nigga just gave me a new Android, I ain't have to pay for it
My nigga just made another draw blood
We all might get charged for it
Can't go to the dome, they got me sinnin', black and white stripes
Or cross me, that's a old head, he tell me that he doin' life
He doin' life, damn

The Weeknd,sad,"I wanna go back
I wanna go back


Uh, 'cause I remember way back when
Got kicked out the crib and had a place to stay
In the Clem with some friends, George and Jay
It was a funky fresh crew and I'd DJ
What a shock it was to be on the set
Comin' from a nice home, now livin' in the projects
No regrets 'cause I learned a lot
And I earned a lot in the parking lot
Doin' dirt for the O.G.'s slangin' rock
They used to call me that little white kid
Who could rock on the two turntables
And that ain't no fable
Watchin' Eddie Murphy instead of Clark Gable
My whole lifestyle switched Hoss
Puttin' in hours at the 76 car wash
But I could never wait for them weekends to come
Dum-ditty-dum-ditty-ditty-dum-dum
Boom-boom, the bass went
On turntables, fuckin' it up in Duke's basement
Groove Time Productions, we kept the jam jumpin'
Open up your ears, I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
And give some love back to those that loved me
206 Court Street, and my second mom, Tracy
Little Keesha and Cole
My mellow blow, and my homegirl Flo
Rock 'round, see, you could find me some
But I kept my tables in the crib when I wasn't in the club
Tom Whit and Mike Shafer used to give me rides
And buy me groceries when I didn't have no paper
And I'm grateful for this
Sometimes I look back and it's these times I miss
Making demos on my old four track
Sometimes I can't help but think, I wanna go back

I wanna go back... back in the time
I wanna go back
I wanna go back... go way back, way back, y'all
I wanna go back... back in the time


I got kicked out again for bein' fly
Got invited to stay with Tony and Eli
And they treated me like brothers
R.I.P. to their cool-ass mother
And my brother Din Dada
For the homies ain't here, I still gotta lot of love
I wanna go back, way back
And change things and bring y'all back
I'm pourin' beer out for y'all
I'm singin' ""I Saw the Light"" from my cousin Paul
Life brings a lot of tragedy
I look around at times and it's so sad to see
A wasted life, or a broken home
But all I can do is take care of my own
I feel so alone like a stranger
And sometimes I express my love through my anger
And I lost a lot of friends for this
Blackman, T-Bone, Ernest KDC, and Chris
And the rest of the Beast Crew
I ain't sayin' that I'm wrong, but I still got love for you
'Cause I remember how it used to be
Make way, motherfuckers, Beast Crew's in the party
To the right, to the left
Many black men and Funk Daddy Def Stef
And sometimes I feel blessed for sure
To have been a part of one of rap's last great tours

I remember little Robert, 'cause I stayed with him
I used to go and see Campbell when I need a trim
And when times got grim and seen that I lost my way
I used to get blown off with Reve
Bumpin' shoulders and slappin' hands
Willie Knight had a disco, right in his basement, man
Them New Haven jams
Me and Blackman running crazy scams
Not a black or white thing, a wrong or right thing
Just makin' that money, and pullin' them honey's
Spandex shorts and the halter tops
Slanging them rocks and runnin' from the cops
The only white kid walkin' round on the block
Cruisin' in Amp's low-ridin' rag-top
Go see Howard for what you need
Underage, buyin' 40s and bags of weed
Late night liquor from Bubba Coles
People used to say, ""Rock, you got soul""
Vince looked out and so did Lou
Had a studio budget from the cocaine loot
Chuck D and Murph were the original three
And now Richard D and Kracker are down with me
I got a studio record and a taste of fame
But when I roll through the Clem, it's all the same
Even though things change, you know I ain't forgot
'Cause the love from the past gave birth to Kid Rock
But it's hard to go back to the things I knew
'Cause the me life, uh, have new lives for two
Yeah, and that's where I'm at

I wanna go back... back in the time (and that's where I'm at)
I wanna go back... go way back, way back, y'all

Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made somethin' of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless


But piece by piece, he collected me

Piece by piece, I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I’m gonna put her first

He'll take care of things, he'll love her

I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare


You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this

I just want you to be happy

I was torn and I was numb
I needed you but you needed anyone

And all our fingers and underneath
Our fingernails that clasp on sheets
As we try desperately to sleep
Hearts are sad and eyes are tired
And all this red bull keeps us wired
It gives us wings
It gives us rings around our eyes

We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch day time tv
And laugh at mums who don’t know who the father is
And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love when you’ve got silicone and strap ons
And beer bloats our spoilt guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eyeing up the what’s and if’s and buts and maybe’s and
Falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week
And we lie drunkenly just staring at the stars

Remember when they were in reach
And all the teachers used to teach

We could’ve done anything
We just never quite knew it

The kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah
I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church
Sometimes I might be introvert
There's a war inside, I hear battle cries
Mothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns
The devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires
Now I don't wanna be the one to doctor this
But if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite
The fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win
I study humans, that makes me an anthropologist
I'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times
Parts of the world still living in apartheid (Thеre's a war, there's a war)
But if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide
Though I should've been a friend when your grandma died
I see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed
I see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death

Internal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)

I hate the thought of just being a burden
I hate that these conversations are surfaced
Simz the artist or Simbi the person?
To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting
I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years
Left wondering how I even feel
But was it even worth it?
I bottle up and then spill it in verses
One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith
Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest
At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own
Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose
Angel said, ""Don't let you ego be a disturbance""
Inner demon said, ""Motherfucker, you earned this""
Like they strip you of everything you're deserving
Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck
Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed
How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough
All we seen is broken homes here and poverty
Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities
How they talking on what's threatening the economy?
Knocking down communities to re-up on properties
I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me
Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see
My speech ain't involuntary
Projecting intentions straight from my lungs
I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one
We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome
But as long as we're unified, then we've already won

Scales, stove, plates, razor, fork, spoon, pot
Clingfilm, plastic bags, lottery tickets cah baggies are hot
Barricade up that door and duh-duh-duh-duh it’s a special knock
Get it right or get splashed on the doorstep
Shit, thought hе was the opps
Got 3 scales and I got my dargs tying up pebs whilе I envelope soft
Dead end road, don’t take the wrong turn on the Hill get more than lost
Who’s fit for the job?

[Verse 1]
Ah shit, here we go again
Blue light on my scales light up
Chop it and bag it, be careful fella
Every crumb that you drop is a fiver
Stain on my boxers from saliva and the bottom of my T-shirt from vagina
Like Tony Hawks and Bam Margera, yeah
I’m a fucking grinder
Ninja, fling metal all in your visor
And flip your girlfriend’s Nissan Micra
Push weight in a tracksuit not Lycra
Grandad hat and a polo, blend in
Got me looking like a minicab driver
Brown girl, white girl in her punani
Never too safe, just in case
Riding shotgun with a screwface
Don’t wanna talk, she’s pissed off
It’s my fault, should’ve made the pack more cylinder shaped
Now I gotta put up with her attitude all cause the inside of her pum pum got scraped
Buy Mac D’s, everything’s okay
2 apple pies and a strawberry milkshake
After I hit the checkpoint safe and sound
Until then everything else can wait

[Chorus]
Gotta see a man about a dog
Please don’t ask me what’s my job
Gotta check the door, make sure that it’s locked
Close all the curtains and turn your phone off
What?
Is he working for the cops?
Please don’t ask me what’s my job
Gotta check the door, make sure that it’s locked

Only money when my mobile rings
Just popping out, I'll be back in a min
Came as a slab, it was dressed in cling
Ronseal, does what it says on the tin
Feds tryna guess what car i'm in
Drove past twice, God bless these tints
Hypocrite, shouldn't even praise no Lord
Cause i'm out here on a devilish ting
Impale and dismember human flesh with enormous bladed things
Every month is December
Got Snow White, but I had 18 midgets
Dark glasses in a pitch black alleyway
Move like Max's shotters
When i'm looking like it's Chronicles of Riddick
Didn't pick numbers, my lottery tickets got loose white girl like Sara Jay's in it
I don't dance, I do the stainless steel bop
Buss two shots for the Hill top
Trespass, you'll be looking Mac D's monopoly
When your face front gets peeled off
Book a flight? I just might and chill off
'Til the heats gone like they cut your bill off
You wake up, no bathe and you're still washed
How you get tumped up and ain't done nothing or now?
Baby bottom you're real soft
Beef, what, where? You ain't ever disect no cow
You just drink milk and feel rough
Break bones, calcium can not heal up
Like that pouch but it looks too small
Gotta consider my tools
Demolition Man like Wesley Snipe
I bruck down tings, I ain't Bob the Builder
Wash white when I cook it up like Tilda
White girl locked in the cupboard, Matilda
Do it on cam with a 'chete like Shilpa
Turn your white T confetti when you spill blood
I was a thief, I used to steal stuff
Now I stuff live corns in real gun
How you try fe fi and you never fo fum?

If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes


Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion


It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize-ize


'Cause one thing I know is this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves
That the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks, I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling, under-the-breath talking
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (Bitches)

'Cause my mind's made up, anyway

Trying to make my friends turn their backs

Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing And Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying not to mention the names of people
Who wanna siphon attention, you like the hype
But pretending you're part of the picture won't pass

Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?

Ed Sheeran,sad,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?


And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again

Without regard to where they are

Your dress is tight
Oh, how, I want you right now

Vi lever på brott
När vi går in, ljudlöst inbrott

Vi chapp allting för vi vann trisslott
Opps de löper som friidrott
Han börja hoppa högt när han hörde ett skott
Inte bloodclart, det Usain Bolt
Blåljus kom, ey, ring en bolt

Varje gång det klubb, tjejer drar mig som en gubbe
Spottar bara eld, det det enda jag kan
Rap som trap, säg ba till jag har kunder
Det är dunder, ta mitt nummer

Rascal Flatts,sad,"She got that ""hey y'all"" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh

Laura Marling,sad,"Night After Night LyricsDarling, I loved you
I long to become you
And know what it is that you gave
We dance the sorrow
Forgive me tomorrow
I pray

Night after night
Day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?
Dear lover forsaken
Our love is taken away
Well
You're my speaker
My innocence-keeper
I don't

Night after night
Day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?

Dear lover forgiven
My love is driven by rage
Oh
I should just leave you
Instead of deceive you
But I don't

Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away

I account no one, hold nobody's ear
I showed you my hand once and you hit me in fear
I don't stand for the devil
I don't whisper in ears
I stand on the mountains and call people to hear

We weep in the evening
And lie naked and pray

Once upon a time, it was paradise

Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down


So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?

I pull you in to feel your heartbeat

Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones

If I happened to devise a plan to go back in time I would happily decline (Why?)

And I think right now I'm in a deep sleep and nobody can wake me

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice

Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be

My nights are long and my days are cold 'cause I don't have you

I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you


Driving 'round, thought I saw you pass me
My rear-view mirror's playing tricks on me 'cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
'Cause my loneliness got the best of me and my heart's so weak

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I was switchin' up the lanes
Steppin' out the frame I'm in
I was pulling on the reins
Sick of all the same happenin'
I swear I was looking for disaster
Mixed with a bottle of gin
And just because I come home after
Doesn't mean you'll take me in
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
You see my world is spinning like there's nothing below
You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get it right, need to see some light come in

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Verse 2: Logic]
Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
I feel like everything I've done before is different now
But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
Every day I do it, I been goin' through it
But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you
I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
I'ma get it right now, don't know how
But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
I'm all in, it's from the heart again
Open up your mind and maybe we could start again

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

The Fray,sad,"Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came


Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and


Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life


As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll goYou might also like26Embed",1
Passenger,sad,"Well there’s a river that runs through Glasgow
And it makes her but it breaks her
And takes her in two parts
And a current just like my blood flows
Down from the hills
Round aching bones to my restless heart


Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And I’m scared I won’t make it to the other side
Well, God knows I’ve failed but He knows that I’ve tried
I long for something that’s safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
I’m as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

On one side all the lights glow
And the folks know and the kids go
Where the music and the drinking starts
On the other side where no cars go
Up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart


Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And I’m scared I won’t make it to the other side
Well, God knows I’ve failed but He knows that I’ve tried
I long for something that’s safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
I’m as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

Shawn Mendes,sad,"I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'


Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes


You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you


Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams


And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way


Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

Passenger,sad,"I know a man with nothing in his hands
Nothing but a rolling stone
He told me about when his house burnt down
And he lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six whole weeks
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing
He said, ""I’ll tell you something
When you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose""

""Now I’ve got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt
A whole lot of trouble"", he said
""But now the money’s gone, life carries on
And I miss it like a hole in the head""
Woah, now, now


I know a woman with kids around her ankles
And a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
And the motherfucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
'But keeping the wolf from the door!'
She said, ""The wolf’s just a puppy and the door’s double locked
So why you gotta worry me for?""


""Now he left a hole in my heart, a hole in a promise
A hole on the side of my bed
Oh, but now that he’s gone, well, life carries on
And I miss him like a hole in the head""

And if I try suicide, would you stop me?

Ed Sheeran,sad,"Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us


And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop


And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar

Love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark
We wish our weekdays away
Spend our weekends in bed
Drink ourselves stupid
And work ourselves dead
And all just because that's what mom and dad said we should do
We should run through the forest
We should swim in the streams
We should laugh, we should cry
We should love, we should dream
We should stare at the stars and not just the screens
You should hear what I'm saying and know what it means

To sing, sing at the top of your voice
Love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark

Well, we wish we were happier, thinner and fitter
We wish we weren't losers and liars and quitters
We want something more not just nasty and bitter
We want something real not just hash tags and Twitter
It's the meaning of life and it's streamed live on YouTube
But I bet Gangnam Style will still get more views
We're scared of drowning, flying and shooters
But we're all slowly dying in front of computers

So sing, sing at the top of your voice
Oh, love without fear in your heart
Can you feel, feel like you still have a choice

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin' at the phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back then I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

I'm a gook!
If I told you that I wasn't then
A nigga wouldn't be telling you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga that ain't nothing new
Yeah I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too

But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you threatz, ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that’s on the set
Fucking with me I will put you to rest
Lie and you’ll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!

Feeling high on the highway
I’m quite alright
Feeling low in my hometown
Close the door and start to cry
Feeling low in my hometown
I’m burning inside

And I aim at the ceiling
But I get the feeling
That I’m gonna fall low
And there’s this fear in my bones
As I reach for the stars
While fighting my wars
And I don’t know
Where this path is gonna go
High low high low
That’s all I know
This life is a rollercoaster
Me you me you
What can I do?
When I feel our hearts beating closer

Looking over your shoulder
I know your eyes are closed
I’ve never felt colder
In a crowded room
And I am so happy
So happy that it makes me sad
My mind has a gift
To turn bad to good and good to bad

I aim at the ceiling
But I get the feeling
That I’m gonna fall low
And there’s this fear in my bones
As I reach for the stars
While fighting my wars

Sara Kays,sad,"Remember That Night? Lyrics
The day after you said, ""Goodbye""
All I did was lay in bed and cry
But after one month, I started to move on
And after two, I felt alright
Then three months in, you were off my mind


And month four and five, I was living my life
I was better and didn't have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out and said
""Remember that night?""

We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, ""Remember that night? Remember that night?""
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, ""Remember that night? Remember that night?""


The day after you had reached out
I was broken for the second time around
I prayed on the third day that I would be okay
That I'd forget you were ever mine
Oh, I don't think you realize


How long I had to fight to be living my life
To get better and never have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out and said
""Remember that night?""


We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, ""Remember that night? Remember that night?""
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, ""Remember that night? Remember that night?""

Pet Shop Boys,sad,"Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could


Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time


You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine


If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind


You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied

Each shoe hit for seven hundred, this a stimmy walk
Teachers used to tell me (Shh), now it cost when Jimmy talk
Good in the Willow, all the opps I got in Ypsi' soft
Put the blue strips and dubs down and let the fifties talk
Bitch switching sides, her middle name should be wishy-wash
I been jamming chips for five plus, let's have a gifty off
Probably knock the plug head off, he try and rip me off
Mean-mugging, clutching on the Drac', do not piss me off
Your boys acting real tough for some fake killers
Send your bitch the drop, when shе get here, havе my way with her
Labels bullshitting, how I'm thinking, I need eight figures
I don't gotta move a muscle, shoutout to them gravediggers
Hoes sneaky than a bitch, it's hard to hear a snake slither
Quarter of the za, a deuce of Wock', these some pain killers
Crunch time, you benchwarm, I'ma hit the game winner
We gon' double back on her, we are not the same spinner
Boy, you better use your brain, don't be thinking with your heart
You know these bitches play it crazy, they'll leave you in the dark
Never did the porch, lil' me was tweaking in the yard
.223'll leave him looking like he sleeping off a bar
Chain three tone and I came Vlone
Did the clerk bold twice, then I came 3-0
In a loft OT, so I came three hoes
Three threats in the morning, so I came three poles
Walking out the bank, smell like Creed in the House of Dank
Medkit cost a couple blues, that's without the Drac'
Real pape', you ain't never made the money counter break
Finna turn my baller on, it's Wocky in my Powerade
Reminiscing 'bout the Runtz, fucked around and found my blanks
Sometimes I wish all the love came without the hate
Shit talker, specialize in giving hoes the sour face
Told the plug I need ten free if he an hour late
Came a long way, I charged a hundred for them first verses
Reach for this chain, we gon' put him in the earth's surface
All the pretty loyal bitches in the world deserve Birkins
Yeah, I'm on the road bright and early, hear the birds chirping
Balaclava on, but my habibi, he prefer turbans
Projector on the beamer, when I skrrt around, the vert German (Skrrt)
Fuck a rat, all the snitches in the world deserve hearses (Die)
High as hell flirting with your bitch, she say my words slurring
Never could I fall off as long as it's clerks working
Had to ask my last bitch like, ""Really, was the dirt worth it?""
Tryna stop the shine, must ain't hear that we burn curtains
Long sleeve or the widebody when we skrrt-skrrting
Unc' flipping oranges, I'm on Apple, finna ship some jacks
He calling for his bitch back, I know I got him pissed I cracked
Riding 'round, see an opp and air him up like Fix-a-Flat
Zip-tight in this motherfucker, this the biggest bag
Bro pop black as fuck, it was a watermelon Crush
Hoes staring at the whole gang, bet they let us fuck
Call my eastside bitch, I guarantee she set 'em up
If I go broke, might crash the whip into the FedEx truck (I swear)
Foot on the fucking gas pedal, I ain't letting up
2021, I'm finna go and get a bezel bust
Glock 22, won't wrestle nothing, I got a Dressler tucked
He spent his last band at the set to impress some sluts
Told your ass once in ""GameBreaker"" 'bout that seven plus
Been a money man since middle school, I had my dresser stuffed
Boy, it's almost summertime, it's time to turn the pressure up
If the BIN hit wherever, I'll pay however much
You sweating through that fake drip, oh, you a musty boy, ain't you?
You ain't got no pape' to eat, oh, you a hungry boy, ain't you?
Six deep in that whip, oh, y'all some crunchy boys, ain't you?

I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

Fearless Soul,good-vibes,"Burning Heart LyricsThere'll always be hearts that will fight
For what they believe to be right
And they're never walking away
When trouble arises, they stay

And history has shown us all
They always heed our call

Burning hearts will lead the way
When we're lost and out of faith
Like a starlight in the night
They're guiding us right
Fearless eyes, a will of steel
Always true to their belief
Standing tall in times of need
Yes, for us they will bleed
The dreamer believes he can fly
When falling, he rises to try
And follow the path of the brave
Whatever it takes and one day

The dream coming true and then
He'll catch a new dream again

Burning hearts will always dream
Lead the way so we can see
Filled with faith, they do believe
That we all can be free
Fearless souls, they never bend
Follow through until the end
Like a flame that won't go out
Beyond any doubt

Heroes have come, they've fought
And they've gone, leaving a fire
So we all, in the night, can follow that light
It's taking us higher

Burning hearts, we're all the same
We can dream and be that flame
We can fight for what is right

I feel like somebody
Even when we eventually fade to nothing
You'll always be my favorite form of loving
When I start to tumble from the sky
You remind me how to fly
Lately I've been feeling not alive
But you bring me back to life

Johnny Cash,sad,"

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear

Ed Sheeran,good-vibes,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was fuck it, 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, go to the telly, hoe!
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart wrap it up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G (I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (that's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

What you gonna do?
The world is watching you
Everyday the choices you make
Say what you are and who
Your heart beats for
It's an open door
It's your life

Are you who you always said you would be?
With a sinking feeling in your chest
Always waiting for somone else to fix you
Tell me when did you forget

This is your oportunity
To let your life be one that lights the way

They had a pet dragonfly

But it came back with a story to say

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

Was colored black by those killing machines

Took down the queen bee and her men

I can change and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must

But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook

Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again

It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers

And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today

And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love


And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now, we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now, my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend

John Mayer,sad,"No, it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No, it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man


No, it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave


So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave

Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope-nope, y'all can't copy
Yeah, bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'

So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said...
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Yeah, lay in yo' shit
Quick to blow on that chopper, it just stay on shit
Fuck the coppers, oppers like a butler, I just wait on shit
Goofy niggas trappin' for three weeks and still ain't made some shit

No thirty-six, we rock forty-ones all day and date a bitch
Made me like five million in one year, bitch, I was made for this
Fuck the talkin', never do no lackin', up and spray the blick
Flashin' hella jewelry at yo' show, we come and takin' shit
Hm, ooh, bitch, I do major shit
All this jewelry light up my whole neck, look like the Vegas Strip

You in the streets and still ain't touched a mil', you on some lazy shit
Crack a seal, finna drink it all, ain't on no savin' shit
Mix the Fendi up with that Dior, I love that Bathing shit
Hit the road, took ten thousand pills between bangin' Tris
Told my bitch to stuff it in her coochie, had to train a bitch
Stretch the work, do that shit like yoga, that's my trainer bitch
Turn that chopper up like a lil' kid, I bend and spank some shit
You the opposite of number two, that mean you ain't the shit
Hit the club and throw me up ten racks, I love the rain and shit
Ghetto girl and she got a fatty, that's my favorite bitch
Got the same bottles in my kitchen, that's my baby sip
Got extension on me, it hold thirty, end up paintin' shit
My mama said I got some screws loose, I need some maintenance
Private jet, oh, we in first class, ain't on no basic shit
Fucked around and got another opp, he on the waiting list
All my homies play in the background because they ain't legit
Lot of habits, need to quit my cup, I can't be taking this
Ooh, yeah, I never fake with stick
Pour me up a three in a cream soda, this a Faygo twist
Niggas in the game and fallin' out on some flagrant shit
How you gang and go against the guys? Yeah, that's plagiarist
Pop a xanny, mix it with a flat, love the zapin' shit
Hella shooters blow shit like a hookah, love to vape and shit

Rhys Lewis,sad,"Day breaks and when I turn
You're not on my pillow
My head shakes and then the penny drops
Still your t-shirt on my chair
Pencilled hearts on paper
I try not to think but I can't stop
And doubt sets in like a storm
I could feel it coming
And words echo out yesterday
Time pushed me to the edge
The jump was my decision
I've only got myself to blame

'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away
I have no right to miss you
When I didn't wanna stay
And I have no right to need you
When I knew what my heart was gonna lose
I have no right to love you
But I do, I still do
Yeah, I still do


Night falls, I'm wide awake
Wishing I could call you
I'm too used to hearing all about your day
The cold creeps up next to me
Now we don't share these covers
But I've no license to complain


'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away

Sometimes I love when my enemy dies
Woo, so ahead of my time
Mainstream boy starts lettin' off lie
We can never, ever, ever level in price
Take that fee, and then treble it twice, yeah
The problem's back, I got flows
Watch your back, I'm on smoke
Dodge the paps and do boat
My boys are maximum boast
Ain't no time to bly man
Know my ting from here to Thailand
You man got that gun off my man
So you man got that gun on finance
Like what's this rented skeng? Buy your own
Use my pen to skeng-fry your dome
Want me to send for them, mind the throne
Cliché, rep your ends, die alone
Cliché, run your guns and die broke
I don't buy in ones, I buy bulk
Yeah, go and bust your gun, I like smoke
Rude boy, mind ya lungs, you might choke
Like cough, cough, puff, puff, pass
You're not tough or hard
They callin' me the virgin Mike
How the hell I bust so fast?
Rude boy, I came and shook my whole era
No cosigns for me and no carers
2019 and I swear I'm goin' clearer
Jar full of dead MCs like Paul Bearer

Why feds put me in court and trial me?
Bad B's get bored and dial me
And ask when we're goin' to the niz, I'm like, ""Shall we?""
Laid back, but still rowdy
Same goons from throwback still 'round me (One)
Funny how my old tings still shout me (One)

Still a youngin but feel like a OG
Can't forget all the shit that they told me
Tired of niggas thinkin' that they know me

Shorty payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom

Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas

I ride by different spots, I get flashbacks
I can't get on your level, I'm past that
Watch me run that shit up, I can't go back to nothin', trying to get to the top of the world

Fuck all that spinnin' blocks, that's that lil' boy shit, we catch him, we rockin' his world (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
I let everybody have they fun with me
Never had a woman say she done with me
I was workin', now I own the company
I keep money coming in constantly

Trying to get it, I've been on the run for weeks
I don't think none of you niggas could come for me
Both of my kids got it honestly
I'm the real deal
All the way, I don't half-step
Gotta do better than last year, that's my motto

We could meet down the line
After all of the time, and
Give an actual try
I can't promise you'll like it
I know I changed overnight
So I can't blame you for fightin'
And I'd be losing my mind
If you lived in your writin'
’Cause now I’m half of myself here without you
You're the best in my life and I lost you
And we had no control when it fell through
It was one-sided, hate how I hurt you
If I could, I’d have changed every feelin'
Reservations were up to the ceilin'
Guess the space was the thing that I needed
But I miss you

And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'

And I pull up my pants, she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich, I done put on my mans
Choppas in traffic, that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin', they wouldn't understand
She take a trip, she come back with a tan
I take a trip, I come back with them bands
When I was dealin', it really was killin' them
Had 'em competin' tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics, I got too many fans
I run this shit, I can do what I want
And it's really a limit, you do what you can
I found the groove and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash, they're gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess He was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can't relate to me 'cause I be poppin'
And put in they face, let them see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'
Hold up, who got Backwood? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me

Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back

We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
Forth with niggas, 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned 8 million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back, 24 (woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the Crock-Pot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot, and it's ready
Might stretch it out but it ain't fetti (yes)
Say my dawg doin' time, but I know he ain't gonna snitch
'Cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly, he told me the whole story over the celly (brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly', no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights they scary

Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
We mix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three, like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Send my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grown up
My cars look different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spend me a hundred on Chevy's
You can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchy my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah I dropped out of school, but that paper on me

Oh, you kept me warm with all your sugarcoats
I held onto your promises too much


(I'm sorry to me too)
For ever believin' you and puttin' my trust in you
Well, now I got no reason to
For givin' you everything and lettin' you take it from me
For all the love I wasted on you


Yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me, to me too
Sorry to me, to me (Too)
Yeah, yeah
Baby, I'm sorry to me


Say you got caught
Up in a suspended reality
Then got scared of what we're not
Leavin' me with all responsibilities

Sam Smith,sad,"Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down, I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh


Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oh, won't you stay with me?

"JP Saxe, Julia Michaels",sad,"I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television?
It's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out
I know, you know, we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
Right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
Right?
I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house
And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
I know, you know, we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
I know, you know, we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over, right?

Kierra Sheard,good-vibes,"Sometimes I talk a little too much
Don't listen enough
Sometimes its way too easy for me to be myself
But sometimes I hate the way I look when I look in the mirror
One look from you I know

(Chorus)
My Flaws
You love, you love my flaws
Think they make me beautiful
You don't see them as flaws at all
That's why
That's why that's why I love you
Cause you are, you are the one who
The one who loves my flaws
(Verse 2)
Sometimes I get a little unsure
A lot insecure
Sometimes I know I might say some words
That might cause some hurt
Sometimes I get in my own way
I'm way too much to put up with
But you put up with it all

(Chorus)
My Flaws
You love, you love my flaws
Think they make me beautiful
You don't see them as flaws at all
That's why
That's why that's why I love you
Cause you are, you are the one who
The one who loves my flaws

(Bridge)
You think I'm everything when I think I'm nothing
When I hate myself you still love me
Love me and

(Chorus)
My Flaws
You love, you love my flaws
Think they make me beautiful
You don't see them as flaws at all
That's why
That's why that's why I love you
Cause you are, you are the one who
The one who loves my flaws
